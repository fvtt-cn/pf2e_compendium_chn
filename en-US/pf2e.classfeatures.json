Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Plating</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>\n<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and the tethered trait.</li>\n</ul>",

You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks.

You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2-4: Summoner Spells per Day.

The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as true strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, remove curse and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>",

You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as normal for a spellcaster.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a psychic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2: Psychic Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is determined by your subconscious mind, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use the modifier for the ability stated in your subconscious mind.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of psychic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level psychic, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level psychic, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<p>As a psychic, you get the ability to improve some of your cantrips with special benefits and psi amps. Over the course of your career, your choice of conscious mind class feature gives you extra cantrips, benefits and psi amps for cantrips, and a collection of unique psi cantrips.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\"><caption>Psychic Spells per Day</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your conscious mind gives you three additional cantrips with amps.

Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p>Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>",

        "Eidolon": {
            "description": "<p>You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>",

Deviations, unfortunately, lack these safeguards, their powers coming from haphazard circumstance and interactions rather than intentional design. A character using their deviation always risks the chance of backlash.</p>\n<p>Whenever you attempt to use a deviation, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:5]. On a success, you use your deviation and the DC for subsequent checks increases by 5, to a maximum of 20 (@Check[type:flat|dc:10] @Check[type:flat|dc:15] @Check[type:flat|dc:20]); on a failure, you use your deviation and then suffer a backlash effect, after which your flat check DC resets to 5. Backlash progresses from mild, to moderate, to severe. When you have already taken mild backlash in a given day, the next time you would take backlash, you take the moderate backlash instead, and if you have already taken moderate backlash, you take the severe backlash instead, and your deviation can't be used for the rest of the day—attempting to use it simply brings pain. When you make your daily preparations, your flat check DC returns to 5 and your next backlash returns to mild.</p>\n<p>Any effects from backlash can't be reduced, prevented, or otherwise bypassed.

            "description": "<p>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field-or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated Impediments</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy Barrier</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Incredible Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner] check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Protections</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency armor).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight Chassis</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Miracle Gears</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistant Coating</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li>\n<li><strong>Runic Keystone</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} and giving it an additional -2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revoluitionary Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack Refiner</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Deadly Strike</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Damage</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only)</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Impossible Alloy</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only)</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only)</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency weapon).</li>\n</ul>",

            "description": "<p>This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CrS0iDwHmjKqvKti]{Flexible Spellcaster Dedication} as your 2nd-level class feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments</strong> You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a spellbook, a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels.</li>\n<li>Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips.</li>\n<li>During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard.</li>\n<li>You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.TTwOKGqmZeKSyNMH]{Feather Fall}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]{Magic Missile}</em> in your spell collection, you could cast <em>feather fall</em> twice that day, <em>magic missile</em> twice, or each spell once.</li>\n<li>Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>RESTRICTED SPELL SLOTS</h3>\n<p>When applying this archetype to a class that grants additional spell slots with restrictions, such as the specialist wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine bond, you still gain those additional slots, but they work as normal for your class, and they don't add more spells to your spell collection. A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal}</em> spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add <em>heal</em> to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Harm}</em> spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.</p>\n<h3>HEIGHTENING SPELLS</h3>\n<p>Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast,similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells.

To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifie , your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element.

You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>",
