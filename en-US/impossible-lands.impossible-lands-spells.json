You send your tongue out at a target within 30 feet with the effect of a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.MVrxZarUTnJxAUN8]{Tether}</em> spell of a spell level 1 lower than the level of your druid focus spells. If your target fails, as long as they are within 30 feet, you can use your tongue to deliver touch range spells against them.</li>\n<li><strong>Cat Sith </strong>– Your body seems to turn shadowy and give off an unsettling aura. The next enemy you target within 1 minute with an effect that requires a saving throw must first make a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)] against your spell DC. On a failure, they roll twice and take the lower result. This is a misfortune effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Cursed Bluebird </strong>– Blue bird wings are faintly visible, covering you as if a cloak. The first time during the duration that a creature hits you with a damaging attack or spell effect, they must first make a @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)] against your spell DC. On a failure, they take half the damage that you took, except it is force damage. On a critical failure, they take the full amount as force damage instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Dryad </strong>– Plant and wood life continuously grows on and around you. The area in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:5] around you is considered difficult terrain, and you are considered @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Concealed]{Concealed} to other creatures.</li>\n<li><strong>Faun </strong>– Your voice becomes melodious and induces fervor. Choose one ally within 30 feet that can hear you. They are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Quickened]{Quickened} for 1 round. During the duration, you can spend an Interact action to similarly quicken an ally that hasn't been targeted during the current casting. Allies can use the extra action to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Sneak]{Sneak}, Step, or Stride.</li>\n<li><strong>Gremlin </strong>– A large number of fey creatures surround you, waiting to do your bidding. You can send them to rapidly dig and burrow to create uneven ground in a @Template[type:burst|distance:5] within 30 feet. Any creature standing in, or walking over, the area must make a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)] against your spell DC. During the duration, you can spend an Interact action to command the fey critters to expand the area of the hole by an additional 5 feet, to a maximum size of a @Template[type:burst|distance:20].</li>\n<li><strong>Monarch </strong>– You grow great green, moth-like wings. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land speed for 1 minute. @UUID[Compendium.impossible-lands.impossible-lands-effects.XHP911Q1DxqXHE2o]{Effect: Shades of Life (Monarch)}</li>\n<li><strong>Unicorn </strong>– A small, shining horn protrudes from your head while the rest of your body sprouts a thin layer of impossibly soft white fur. During the duration, you can spend 1 Interact action to heal yourself or an adjacent ally for a number of [[/r (max(floor(@actor.level /2), 1)d6) + @abilities.wis.mod]]{d6 equal to half your level plus your spellcasting ability modifier}.
