			"name": "Armor Storm",
			"description": "<p>Your armor is like an extension of your skin (or other appropriate surface layer), and you're able to leverage it alongside the heavy weapons you employ. Foes you suppress quickly stumble while attempting to overcome your durability, granting you an edge in absorbing their incoming firepower. You likely move to the forefront and try to focus your enemy's attention on yourself.</p>\n<p>You never count as being in the area of a ranged weapon you've made an attack with. In addition, you gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) against attacks made from @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} targets.</p>"

			"description": "<p>There's nothing like a reliable heavy gun (or maybe several different types of heavy guns) to get you through the tough times of adventuring in space. You've come to terms with the fact that your weapons might sometimes hit your allies but work to minimize such instances of unintentional \"friendly fire.\" In fact, you've honed your skill with heavy weapons so much that all but the most indirect of strikes causes your opponents to duck down or force them to adapt to the havoc you unleash.</p>\n<p>When you attack with an area weapon, you adjust the shot to allow allies to better avoid it. Decrease the DC by 2 for any allies who need to make a save against your area effects. In addition, enemies who succeed (but not critically succeed) their save against an area attack you make are still @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn.</p>"

		"Close Quarters": {
			"name": "Close Quarters",
			"description": "<p>While you still have the necessary training to employ heavy weapons, you've learned that it's important to keep a backup for when foes get too close. You're able to easily switch between long range and close combat, allowing you to better stand your ground when you need to, or defend your allies in a tricky situation. Blows with heavy close combat weapons punish your foes just as effectively as when you fire a rotolaser or a missile launcher.</p>\n<p>When you successfully make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon, you @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} the target until the start of your next turn. In addition, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.rgZ9EvqnyGdafiMv]{Punitive Strike} reaction.</p>"

If two or more creatures are closest and equidistant, you can choose which one is your primary target. Other creatures within the area of effect must save against the effect as normal. If you successfully hit your primary target, then that target is @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn.</p>"

When determining your Strength threshold for using medium or heavy armor, you can instead choose to use your Constitution modifier. If you already meet the Strength requirement for the armor you're wearing, reduce that armor's Bulk by 1 (to a minimum of 1). In addition, increase the amount of Bulk you can carry before becoming encumbered by half your Constitution modifier rounded up. Increase your maximum carried Bulk by your Constitution modifier rounded up.</p>"
