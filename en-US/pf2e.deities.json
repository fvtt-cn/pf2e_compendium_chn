Thanks to them, citizens of Mzali and beyond have been reminded of her loving embrace, and once again awaken with resolve in their hearts.</p>\n<p>Tlehar keeps watch over every birth and new beginning, as there is no greater symbol of hope than new life.

People fleeing from unsafe homes can seek out her followers for safe refuge; these followers of Tlehar wear discrete, iron charms to let others know that they will be ready to fight for them.

While Tlehar is not typically as strict in her justice as her counterparts, she shows no mercy to those who hurt the ones they claim to love.

New life crawls forth from their primordial depths in an explosion of the bizarre and colorful, adjusting in their own individual ways to the challenges of existence. As each life moves through the various cycles of growth over time, they must be flexible and adapt to the changes, especially at its crux—the state of transition. Sometimes a new step involves a frightening destruction of identity, but it should be embraced instead of feared, as the primordial nothingness holds the potential for new creations beyond the wildest imaginings of one's current self. Those who stay rigid in their beliefs or refuse to change will become trapped in the shells of their old selves and crush themselves in their struggle to avoid growth. Aakriti also has no love for those who entrap creatures into a form unwillingly and will sometimes intercede against them.</p>\n<p>Aakriti's faith is relatively sparse within the Inner Sea region, mostly seen in small pockets within Desna's followers or the alchemists of ooze-infested Oenopion. As the more adventurous members of those communities, such as bards, travel to distant lands, word of Aakriti's belief spreads.

Creatures of great size, such as elephants and dinosaurs, are sacred to him, as are natural features that dominate the landscape like mountains and massive trees. Balumbdar is also a god of strength, but of might born of great size rather than training or skill. Balumbdar is considered brutish and dim-witted by most other gods, but the fact that he towers over them in any interaction means he always commands respect. When he bothers to manifest at all, it is as a startlingly large man with slabs of muscle and equally thick rolls of fat. He sometimes instead appears as a city-sized animal or as imposing clouds, heavy with rain and low to the ground.</p>\n<p>Balumbdar's worshippers see their god's might in storms that shred a forest but leave the tallest trees standing, or avalanches that roll across buildings yet leave the mountain untouched. This, they know, is the power of size: to endure when the rest of the world is weak and small. They seek to emulate their god by growing large, either by developing their muscles or becoming immensely fat.</p>\n<p>Balumbdar himself is uncaring about how great size and strength is used, but his followers generally divide themselves into two schools of thought. Those who feel that it is incumbent upon the large to tread upon the small are usually evil. Those who feel that size imparts an obligation to protect the small are usually good. Druids often revere Balumbdar because of his relationship with the natural world, and they adopt the care of animals much larger than they are-or at times, animals that are much smaller, to demonstrate Balumbdar's stalwart guardianship of smaller creatures.</p>\n<p>The Elephant People revere Balumbdar, but not by name; they know that some ancient divine sponsor sent the elephants to the world to guide others.

The Wind followed Yelayne everywhere, tugging on her hair and rumpling the beautiful clothing that she worked so hard to craft. She ignored him, because she was wise and knew the Wind could be fickle and cruel. When he persisted in pursuing her against her wishes, she brought out her most tightly‑woven bag and whistled for the Wind's attention. When he came rushing, she trapped him in the bag. Ever afterward, she only let the Wind out if he promised to obey her. Yelayne had the Wind carry her all over the world, teaching the art of weaving to any who would work at it and learning how to make the most fantastical clothes. When she tired of that, she had the Wind carry her to Heaven, where she wove starlight into constellations, sunshine into rainbows, and moonbeams into enchantments. She still watches to make sure that none are left exposed for the old Wind to bother, and that all are able to pursue their creative endeavors, express themselves, and dress how they like.</p>\n<p>While Yelayne's worship originated in the hearty holdings of central and northern Iobaria, it has spread throughout the Inner Sea region.

She embodies two aspects halflings see in themselves: a strong affinity for luck and bold determination to protect friends. Chaldira is hotheaded and cannot abide bullies in any form, and many of her worshippers are similarly impetuous, spoiling for any opportunity to leap fist-first at oppressors and tyrants. While many people consider this to be more of a vice than a virtue, Chaldira and her followers feel it is far better to run headlong into trouble than it is to meekly concede to evil out of fear or convenience. Chaldira is also the goddess of light-hearted mischief, insisting that harmless fun, even at others' expense, brings joy and strengthens ties within a community. While not all of Chaldira's followers are inveterate pranksters, most at least know some sleight-of-hand tricks. Chaldira is most often depicted as a halfling woman who matches the appearance of the local halfling community, with curly hair, freckles, and a patchwork red-and-green coat held together by several mismatched buttons.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Chaldira Zuzaristan is a halfling goddess who encourages her followers to protect the innocent, oppose tyranny, punch evil in the gut, and have fun while doing it. Much beloved by the Firebrands, she's also known as the Calamitous Turn. Generally considered a brave, hot-headed goddess, Chaldira is bold and tenacious. She trusts her instincts, follows her heart, and fights for what's right no matter the odds or opposition. This message resonates strongly with many Firebrands, regardless of their methodology.</p>\n<p>For these Firebrands, Chaldira's most attractive qualities are her drive, determination, and pluck. She's the goddess they turn to when opposing a power bigger than themselves, whether through combat, guile, or social reform. From revolutionaries and activists who seek social and political change to do-gooders who literally fight tyrannical regimes, Chaldira is a source of bravery, comfort, and encouragement. Many Firebrands who follow Chaldira become leaders of rebellions or Firebrand cells as well as organizers of rallies, covert missions, uprisings, and other similar endeavors.</p>\n<p>Chaldira is also a goddess of luck, and Firebrands about to undertake a particularly dangerous task often pray for her blessing. Integrating oversized, brightly colored buttons into one's attire has become a popular fashion trend among Firebrands and is intended to honor Chaldira or curry her favor. Those Firebrands who operate discreetly instead sew the buttons into their pockets, waistbands, or the lining of their coats for luck.</p>\n<p>Chaldira is a friendly goddess who frequently cooperates with other divinities. She draws Desna and Kurgess on madcap adventures, partners with Cayden Cailean or Milani to topple tyrants, and joins Picoperi or Thisamet when spreading laughter and mischief. Similarly, Chaldira's worshippers strive to build communities and strengthen bonds of togetherness, both among the people of the regions in which they operate and within the Firebrands themselves. Rebellions and political change require public support to succeed, and this support can only come from a community that feels united.

The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> challenge religious power and the spread of religion, expose and eradicate hidden worship, provide a peaceful and autonomous society in which the people are cared for through social infrastructure</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> worship or swear an oath by a deity or religion, solicit or receive divine or religious aid, take a side in conflicts between religions</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> mortal affairs, peace, self-rule</p>",

            "description": "<p>Fandarra is primarily worshipped throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords as a goddess of life cycles—including fertility, birth, life, and death. Local legends claim Fandarra was birthed from the earth's womb, the legendary cave Atakal, as the first living being. From her, all other life sprang. She gave birth to all people, all animals, and all deities—except for Pharasma, the Judge of Souls, who exists outside of the cycle of life and death. The blood spilled during these labors soaked the soil, making it fertile and causing plants to grow. Blood, death, and pain are nothing to fear. Like life, they're a normal and integral part of the life cycle and should be respected. Fandarra is the Mother of All, also known as the Earth Mother or the Blood Mother, and is one of the most widely worshipped deities throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords.</p>\n<p>In addition to her role as a goddess of life cycles and blood, Fandarra is a goddess of knowledge. As elders educate children, so has Fandarra brought her wisdom to the beings of this world. Outside the Realm of the Mammoth Lords,</p>\n<p>Fandarra is primarily known as a goddess of giants. Within the Realm, she's depicted as a pregnant Kellid woman with a shaved head crowned by a laurel of flowers. She wears a necklace of knives that she wields against those who would usurp the cycles of life; on her shoulders rests a fur cloak suitable to the region of her worship—usually mammoth, wolf, or bear. She carries an infant in one arm and a juvenile animal in the other. Typically, this animal is a mammoth, although it can vary for followings that prize other animals more.</p>\n<p>Fandarra's religious symbol is a crescent moon emerging from a mountain. Her worshippers value balance and the cycles of life, traits which enable her faith to mesh well with the beliefs and traditions of a variety of followings. Her worshippers often gravitate toward positions of leadership or work as doulas, educators, or funerary guides that tend to the deceased. Many of Fandarra's worshippers cherish family, whether of their own blood or adopted through bonds of love; furthermore, many view friends, clanmates, and pets as extended family.

She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. Calistria is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her-though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Calistria is the impassioned goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery.

Many in positions of power whisper prayers in hopes of placating the wrath of the Savored Sting. Meanwhile, numerous oppressed, downtrodden, abused, and betrayed people cry out to her seeking vengeance.

No matter if they're intellectual pursuits, devising cunning plots, meticulously planning lavish entertainment, or enjoying pleasures of the flesh, they revel in life and all its heady sensations. The high proportion of entertainers and sensation seekers within Calistria's faithful naturally aligns with the Firebrands' constituency. Passions ebb and flow and disparate interests frequently create what would seem to be irreparable fractures within the organizations. However, like a threatened swarm of wasps, they quickly set aside personal differences to relentlessly battle common threats, throw off oppression, or seek vengeance.</p>\n<p>Firebrand safe houses are often repurposed apartments, manor houses, and homes liberated from former oppressors. Firebrands refurbish many of these properties as salons, guild houses, brothels, and temples to Calistria. Across Golarion, these richly appointed gathering places are centers of intellectual discussion, brokerage points for illicit information, intimate settings for rendezvous, and discreet waystations for traveling Firebrands.

This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke Alseta the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as Tanagaar the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to Alseta for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From Korada, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all. Services are offered daily at dawn and dusk, typically accompanied by serene music and time for contemplation and meditation.

            "description": "<p>Appearing in art more than any of the other empyreal lords, the Spirit of Abandon represents freedom, physical beauty, and sexuality. More than anything else, freedom is what matters to Arshea. For many this is most commonly seen as freedom for sexual expression, but Arshea represents the freedom to experience all that is good in the world, be it an ideology or a specific emotional or physical expression. So long as it doesn't harm others, Arshea believes creatures should do, think, and feel as they will. They encourage their followers to try new things, to think in new ways, and to wear new forms.</p>\n<p>When appearing to mortals, the Spirit of Abandon most commonly appears in that person's own body so the person may see how beautiful and perfect their own form is-after all, if a divine being has chosen to wear it, it must be perfect. For people who don't fit in the body they currently wear, Arshea often appears in the form reflected in their heart and soul. Followers of Arshea are a varied lot, from artists to explorers, and from lovers to those who fight against repression.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Arshea, the Spirit of Abandon, is an angelic champion of freedom, beauty, and sexuality, fighting on behalf of all who are repressed or powerless in their own lives. They are a celestial spirit of change and mortal joy, and they teach their followers to pursue their own personal happiness and fulfillment no matter the form it takes, reveling in the beauty of their lives without shame or judgment.</p>\n<p>While both sexual pleasure and freedom of sexual expression are embraced by the Spirit of Abandon, they also teach their followers that there are infinite forms mortal delight and mortal freedom can take, including the freedom to refrain from sexual experiences, regardless of the reason. Provided all such pursuits are done with consent, all enjoyment is equal in the eyes of Arshea.</p>\n<p>The Arshean faith is popular among the Firebrands, and the cult of Arshea is a ready and stable ally to the Firebrands' revolutionary efforts. As the angel's teachings appeal both to those focused on their own pleasure and the freedom to pursue it, and to those who fight against tyrants and work to preserve the freedom of others, Arshea is popular among many informal factions within the organization.</p>\n<p>In addition to freedom from tyranny, the Spirit of Abandon also embodies freedom of expression and freedom of choice. Personal expression and identity are important values for many Firebrands, and this freedom to be one's true self is sacred in the Arshean faith. Arshea is an angel of beauty, but Arsheans know that beauty is ephemeral, always changing to suit the beholder. The celestial spirit encourages their followers to change themselves to suit their personal tastes, and to dress, groom, and present themselves as any gender and in any way that brings them peace and happiness, without regard for the appeal their choices hold for anyone but themselves.</p>\n<p>When choosing their battles, Arshean Firebrands tend to view all forms of social division, such as strict gender roles, as undesirable and harmful, rather than only those with explicit power differentials. They believe all people should be free to express themselves in any way they choose, and to change between as many identities as they choose as often as they wish, often in opposition of a society's social structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Inspire passion, comfort and free the repressed, seek your true self and desires</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Judge another based on sexual desires or gender roles, act without consent in pursuit of passion</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> freedom, physical beauty, and sexuality</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ckUOoqOM7Kg7VqxB]{Avatar} spell, a worshipper of Arshea becomes a fluid, shifting humanoid that changes appearance, gender, and form moment by moment, though the caster can choose one specific form if desired.

His followers range from gnolls to charau-kas to nalfeshnee demons that number in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Angazhan has astounding presence and influence, but that influence is rivaled by his raw power. He is skilled enough with weapons, but prefers to use his own abilities-his powerful fists, lethal fangs, sharp horns, and deadly tail. His terrible grasp extends beyond life into death, as well. Occasionally, those slain in combat by Angazhan's minions are reincarnated forcefully into an ape-like creature in the service of the Ravenous King. This curse causes the victim to serve eternally, and only upon death is there a chance for their soul to be retrieved before it slips into the Boneyard, to be sent on and suffer a never-ending torment in the Abyss.</p>\n<p>A pledge to Angazhan is a commitment to acquiring power. Angazhan encourages followers to destroy all who oppose them with relentless force, to dominate until nothing is left to challenge, and to treat obstacles as something to be crushed with swiftness. Those who fail these commands are quick to be cast aside. This strength lures dangerous figures, thievish creatures, and terrifying beings.

He turned the tide against Gavidya the Numberless's hordes, and struck true against Taraksun the Wakener of Wrath.

            "description": "<p>Throughout the Mwangi, there are few as highly respected as storytellers. As stewards of their peoples' oral traditions, they act as historians, educators, and entertainers, so it is only right that they pay homage to the goddess of stories, Grandmother Spider. Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider was once content in her role as weaver of fate for the gods, as it gave her the ability to craft the grandest tales anyone had ever known. But as she told story after story at the other gods' whims, they failed to show proper respect to the one who made their glorious and terrible legends come to pass, treating her as a servant or a tool. Grandmother had no patience for overinflated egos, and even less for those who take credit for the work of others. She crafted unique humiliations tailored to each of the gods, and as tales of her mischief spread, she wove her own divinity from them. Some of the more prideful gods deny her still-worshiping Grandmother Spider is forbidden by Asmodeus for as long as she still twirls copies of his keys around her fingers, and Abadar still holds a grudge since the Century of the Unbalanced Scale. To the north of the Mwangi, there are almost no shrines dedicated to Grandmother Spider. But the clever and willful always find ways to revere her.</p>\n<p>No matter how their pride might be wounded, few have dared to take direct action against Grandmother Spider. Alone, she is dangerous enough, for they say Nana Anadi holds all the secrets of the world within her web. However, her sibling Achaekek, the Red Mantis, is a force that even gods fear. Though he treats his sister with indifference, he once lashed out at someone who sought to do Grandmother Spider harm with disproportionate retribution. That one act has been more than enough.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider uplifts those who rebel against the status quo, strike above their station, or otherwise fight for freedom. While she prefers subterfuge and cleverness, she does not eschew violence, viewing it as simply another tool-applied judiciously in the right place at the right time, it can accomplish a great deal. Abolitionists and freedom fighters across Mwangi view spiders as an omen of good fortune. Those who are forced to live and fight in secret against their oppressors take great comfort in the knowledge that Nana Anadi will still tell their stories long after they are gone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Grandmother Spider, also known as Nana Anadi, is a goddess of storytelling who once wove fate and reality into existence at the behest of other gods. She values independence, family, and cleverness, and despises when the unworthy hold power over others.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider's faith is exceedingly rare in Avistan, but it's incredibly strong in Garund. She's a favorite among Firebrands who chafe under authority, seek retribution against their oppressors, or operate through cleverness, guile, and stealth. Her followers tend to utilize clever plans, political maneuvering, and public humiliation over more violent methods of change. Once avenged, such Firebrands usually attempt to find others struggling under oppressive or incompetent rule and help them \"reweave fate\" by sparking revolution or governmental reform.</p>\n<p>Firebrands who worship Grandmother Spider tend to be serious, focusing on altruistic goals rather than personal accolades, fame, or wealth. They value stories and strive to remember the comrades they've lost, to learn from their mistakes and maintain their legacy beyond death. Many can inspire or manipulate others through stories or craft convincing lies, distractions, or illusions. Among the Firebrands, the most famous of Grandmother Spider's worshippers are Nana's Chosen, also referred to as the Spiteweft. Nana's Chosen are eight Firebrands who specialize in toppling tyrants, monarchs, bureaucrats, and other powerful leaders they deem \"undeserving\" through a series of increasingly ignominious public humiliations, usually involving the seeding of rumors; the exposure of secrets, betrayals, and weaknesses; manufactured public embarrassments; and proving their professional incompetence.</p>\n<p>Yet one need not devote one's life to Grandmother Spider to receive her aid, for the Weaver blesses all who question established hierarchies, usurp the status quo, or fight for freedom. Spiders are considered a good omen, as is the sight of a pristine spider's web or animals traveling in groups of eight. Those aiming to court her favor wear fabrics featuring diamonds or spiders, while those in need of subtlety or with little wealth to spare instead stitch a simple diamond into their clothes or paint a diamond upon their skin with paints or mud.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider is the patron goddess of the spider-like anadi people, said to have led them out of darkness and to freedom at some nebulous point in the ancient past. Thus, many Firebrands of other ancestries consider it good luck to work alongside an anadi and go out of their way to join a cell led by an anadi or recruit anadis to the Firebrands.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, enslave someone</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> family, illusion, stories, twilight, weaving</p>",

Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali.

She also taught the importance of what they protected, identifying the hearth and the home, as well as the right to self-determination and to solitude, as worthy of defense. She is said to have instilled in the amurruns their need for solitude and their esteem of imagination. A master teacher, she is depicted as a graying catfolk woman or a cat by the hearth fire, her large, gentle eyes full of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The tenets of Adanye's faith are few and flexible. She helps the curious and the wandering to retain their sense of self and their need to stay safe as they discover and grow. She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present-the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.</p>\n<p>Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods.

Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment.

Unlike her worship in other parts of the world, worshippers in Mwangi tend to embrace Mazludeh's duality. To deny either side of her would be to deny a part of her, and both are necessary to fully understand the deity.

Though the decision to take up the challenge may have been spontaneous, and the first few attempts were hasty and impulsive, failure is the mother of success, and for those who worship Jin Li, the success in the end often transcends even what they envisioned in the first place.</p>\n<p>Most of Jin Li's worshippers are located in self-sufficient farming communities far away from cities in the regions of Quain, Lingshen, and Poli. There, the dragon carp inspires many to find a vocation to dedicate themselves to, and to seek joy and fun in challenges. Charms depicting the god, while they can serve as religious symbols, are more often treated as a gift of blessing and witness to one's deeds. Worship of Jin Li is also popular among bureaucrats, for his transformation from fish to dragon is thought to symbolize promotions.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> take up dares and challenges in good faith, persist with creativity and tenacity, own up to your failures in pursuit of self-improvement</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> give up without trying, dismiss or mock someone's effort, take success for granted, discount the power of beginner's luck or luck in general</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> challenges, dares, promotions, and self-improvement</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the avatar spell, a worshipper of Jin Li becomes a glorious dragon carp.

Capable of breathing above and below water, swimming through the water, and flopping across the ground, their body is muscular and constantly moving. They gain the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Jin Li</strong> Speed 30 feet, swim 60 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain; can breathe underwater</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> smashing flop (backswing, reach 15 feet, shove), Damage [[/r (6d8+6)[bludgeoning]]]</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> mighty splash (range 60 feet), Damage [[/r (4d6+3)[bludgeoning]]] plus [[/r (1d6[splash])[bludgeoning]]]splash.

            "description": "<p>Once nothing more than a powerful spirit of water with the ability to manipulate sea monsters, Besmara grew slowly in power over the centuries from sacrifices made by seafaring people. After defeating and consuming rival spirits of battle, gold, and wood, she became a minor god of piracy, strife, and sea monsters.</p>\n<p>Besmara, the Pirate Queen, cuts a brash and bold figure, as she often is depicted wearing buccaneer apparel consisting of loose-fitting, eye-catching clothing and black boots, and her hair is wind-tossed on even the calmest day. She and her followers adhere to a simple code of greed: take what you desire, no matter who it might belong to. Despite this, Besmara and her worshippers are generally loyal to one another, knowing that while on the waves raiding ships for treasure, a pirate crew can survive only if its members trust one another.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Pirate Queen Besmara began as a minor deity and gained power as she defeated other demigods. Now, with her rule over sea monsters and piracy, she attracts worshippers within the Firebrands. They likely spend more energy to ward off her ire than maintain her favor, as her temperament turns quickly. While her interest in them is fickle, she has granted them boons while in a good mood. The Firebrands must also contend with her less savory worshippers, such as undead crews seeking souls to consume. Despite the danger, Besmara fascinates many Firebrands, as using chaos to succeed matches their tactics.</p>\n<p>Her deeds serve as inspiration, as she managed to defeat countless other demigods and used their power to ascend to her full godhood. As the Pirate Queen and her ship the Seawraith raid the other planes and retreat back into the chaos of the Maelstrom, so do the Firebrands take advantage of the Eye of Abendego to raid well-off merchants or naval vessels and retreat into the safety of the storm. Her tendency to wait for the right tides or a lull in the enemy's defenses exemplifies the need to wait for the perfect circumstances.</p>\n<p>The Firebrands' acceptance of Besmara attracts worshippers eager for glory and derring-do. As Besmara's armada is crewed by legendary pirates whose deeds outpaced their mortality, joining the Firebrands and becoming a legend among legends provides a way to catch Besmara's eye. A few reckless captains attract first- and second-mark Firebrands with the promise of breaking records and doing the impossible.</p>\n<p>When finding a windfall, every Firebrand captain or crew gives Besmara her due by tossing a share of the profit into the sea, ensuring that they don't provoke her ire. No captain wants to be responsible for an organization-wide rash of ill luck and dead winds. If there is a period of doldrums, captains provide extra tribute to avoid finger-pointing and pray for a break in the still air.</p>\n<p>Even the Firebrands who don't see themselves as pirates find meaning in the code of loyalty Besmara's devotees follow. Loyalty to crew, shipmates, and captains runs deep, especially with more formal pirate codes developed among Shackles Firebrands. Pirate codes among crews of Firebrands include a binding oath administered by a member of the Besmaran clergy. While each code is personalized to suit circumstances, these codes typically define \"crew\" to include land-based allies and other Firebrands.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> sail the seas, stay loyal to captain and crew, take what you want</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> betray shipmates, forsake piracy, settle on land</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> piracy, sea monsters, and strife</p>",

While the Mwangi Expanse is home to many demon hunters that keep these evil forces at bay, many of them work in independent groups.

This led to the worship of a pantheon of righteous gods that both offered the might to destroy demons and the wisdom to defend others. Through the worship of Adanye, Chohar, Kazutal (in her form as Majagua), and Torag, these mighty hunters find the strength they need to make the Mwangi Expanse a safer place.
