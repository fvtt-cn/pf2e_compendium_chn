Thanks to them, citizens of Mzali and beyond have been reminded of her loving embrace, and once again awaken with resolve in their hearts.</p>\n<p>Tlehar keeps watch over every birth and new beginning, as there is no greater symbol of hope than new life. Midwives and nurses pray to Tlehar to keep watch over their work and ensure the health of newborns.

While Tlehar is not typically as strict in her justice as her counterparts, she shows no mercy to those who hurt the ones they claim to love.

The most popular theory, as reflected in various religious iconography, is that Aakriti is the pupae of a primordial deity that took damage in their chrysalis state and became unable to molt into their final form.</p>\n<p>Known as Aakriti the Evershifting, this ooze deity represents the ever‑evolving nature of creation and life as well the potential of the unknown. New life crawls forth from their primordial depths in an explosion of the bizarre and colorful, adjusting in their own individual ways to the challenges of existence. As each life moves through the various cycles of growth over time, they must be flexible and adapt to the changes, especially at its crux—the state of transition. Sometimes a new step involves a frightening destruction of identity, but it should be embraced instead of feared, as the primordial nothingness holds the potential for new creations beyond the wildest imaginings of one's current self. Those who stay rigid in their beliefs or refuse to change will become trapped in the shells of their old selves and crush themselves in their struggle to avoid growth. Aakriti also has no love for those who entrap creatures into a form unwillingly and will sometimes intercede against them.</p>\n<p>Aakriti's faith is relatively sparse within the Inner Sea region, mostly seen in small pockets within Desna's followers or the alchemists of ooze-infested Oenopion. As the more adventurous members of those communities, such as bards, travel to distant lands, word of Aakriti's belief spreads. Most centers of worship for Aakriti aren't permanent temples, but instead small, portable shrines made of malleable, decomposable materials like clay and paper.</p>\n<p>When Aakriti makes the rare appearance to a mortal, they appear as an ever-shifting oobleck of varied hues, moving from a crawling larva to pulsating pupa, morphing into a butterfly before transforming into another form.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> create without reservation, help others unlock their true potential, observe the mysteries of life</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> fail to study a new creature if safely able, force a creature to live in the wrong body, reject creatures or information due to bigoted or rigid beliefs</p>",

Balumbdar is also a god of strength, but of might born of great size rather than training or skill. Balumbdar is considered brutish and dim-witted by most other gods, but the fact that he towers over them in any interaction means he always commands respect. When he bothers to manifest at all, it is as a startlingly large man with slabs of muscle and equally thick rolls of fat. He sometimes instead appears as a city-sized animal or as imposing clouds, heavy with rain and low to the ground.</p>\n<p>Balumbdar's worshippers see their god's might in storms that shred a forest but leave the tallest trees standing, or avalanches that roll across buildings yet leave the mountain untouched. This, they know, is the power of size: to endure when the rest of the world is weak and small. They seek to emulate their god by growing large, either by developing their muscles or becoming immensely fat.</p>\n<p>Balumbdar himself is uncaring about how great size and strength is used, but his followers generally divide themselves into two schools of thought. Those who feel that it is incumbent upon the large to tread upon the small are usually evil. Those who feel that size imparts an obligation to protect the small are usually good. Druids often revere Balumbdar because of his relationship with the natural world, and they adopt the care of animals much larger than they are-or at times, animals that are much smaller, to demonstrate Balumbdar's stalwart guardianship of smaller creatures.</p>\n<p>The Elephant People revere Balumbdar, but not by name; they know that some ancient divine sponsor sent the elephants to the world to guide others.

The Wind followed Yelayne everywhere, tugging on her hair and rumpling the beautiful clothing that she worked so hard to craft. She ignored him, because she was wise and knew the Wind could be fickle and cruel. When he persisted in pursuing her against her wishes, she brought out her most tightly‑woven bag and whistled for the Wind's attention. When he came rushing, she trapped him in the bag. Ever afterward, she only let the Wind out if he promised to obey her. Yelayne had the Wind carry her all over the world, teaching the art of weaving to any who would work at it and learning how to make the most fantastical clothes. When she tired of that, she had the Wind carry her to Heaven, where she wove starlight into constellations, sunshine into rainbows, and moonbeams into enchantments. She still watches to make sure that none are left exposed for the old Wind to bother, and that all are able to pursue their creative endeavors, express themselves, and dress how they like.</p>\n<p>While Yelayne's worship originated in the hearty holdings of central and northern Iobaria, it has spread throughout the Inner Sea region.

Many Firebrands who follow Chaldira become leaders of rebellions or Firebrand cells as well as organizers of rallies, covert missions, uprisings, and other similar endeavors.</p>\n<p>Chaldira is also a goddess of luck, and Firebrands about to undertake a particularly dangerous task often pray for her blessing.

She draws Desna and Kurgess on madcap adventures, partners with Cayden Cailean or Milani to topple tyrants, and joins Picoperi or Thisamet when spreading laughter and mischief. Similarly, Chaldira's worshippers strive to build communities and strengthen bonds of togetherness, both among the people of the regions in which they operate and within the Firebrands themselves. Rebellions and political change require public support to succeed, and this support can only come from a community that feels united. Likewise, Chaldiran Firebrands are among those who encourage teamwork and collaboration between Firebrand cells. They act as messengers, go-betweens, facilitators, and greatly enjoy seeing a \"team-up\" between different Firebrand groups. They're the first to remind their fellows that, while the Firebrands face insurmountable odds, they needn't do so alone. Just as a single voice can be drowned out but a multitude can't be silenced, while one Firebrand is great, together they're unstoppable.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> seek out and challenge oppressors and tyrants, defend friends and the innocent, engage in mischief that doesn't harm others</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> suffer a bully's insults to you or another without retort, abandon a friend in need, attribute a lucky turn of events to your own skill</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> battle, fortune, mischief</p>",

The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> challenge religious power and the spread of religion, expose and eradicate hidden worship, provide a peaceful and autonomous society in which the people are cared for through social infrastructure</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> worship or swear an oath by a deity or religion, solicit or receive divine or religious aid, take a side in conflicts between religions</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> mortal affairs, peace, self-rule</p>",

The blood spilled during these labors soaked the soil, making it fertile and causing plants to grow. Blood, death, and pain are nothing to fear. Like life, they're a normal and integral part of the life cycle and should be respected. Fandarra is the Mother of All, also known as the Earth Mother or the Blood Mother, and is one of the most widely worshipped deities throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords.</p>\n<p>In addition to her role as a goddess of life cycles and blood, Fandarra is a goddess of knowledge. As elders educate children, so has Fandarra brought her wisdom to the beings of this world. Outside the Realm of the Mammoth Lords,</p>\n<p>Fandarra is primarily known as a goddess of giants. Within the Realm, she's depicted as a pregnant Kellid woman with a shaved head crowned by a laurel of flowers. She wears a necklace of knives that she wields against those who would usurp the cycles of life; on her shoulders rests a fur cloak suitable to the region of her worship—usually mammoth, wolf, or bear. She carries an infant in one arm and a juvenile animal in the other. Typically, this animal is a mammoth, although it can vary for followings that prize other animals more.</p>\n<p>Fandarra's religious symbol is a crescent moon emerging from a mountain. Her worshippers value balance and the cycles of life, traits which enable her faith to mesh well with the beliefs and traditions of a variety of followings. Her worshippers often gravitate toward positions of leadership or work as doulas, educators, or funerary guides that tend to the deceased. Many of Fandarra's worshippers cherish family, whether of their own blood or adopted through bonds of love; furthermore, many view friends, clanmates, and pets as extended family. Fandarra and her worshippers abhor necromancy, undead, and magic that would alter reality or enslave the minds of others.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> abide by the cycles of life, aid childbirth, destroy undead</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> strive to break the cycle of life (such as by attaining immortality or creating undead), despoil the earth, kill a juvenile creature</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> blood, the cycle of life, fertility, knowledge</p>",

Meanwhile, numerous oppressed, downtrodden, abused, and betrayed people cry out to her seeking vengeance.

That path is never an easy one, but it is one worth walking, and she stands beside those who make the trek. For the truly wicked and those who show no remorse, she has no mercy. For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes.

When formulating new rituals, arcane practitioners ask him to guide their hands in selecting metal powders for their binding rings. Alchemists whisper an oath to him as they mix volatile compounds.

In these forms, he always appears in bright yellow and green coloring, either as the scales on the belly of a snake, the markings of a tabby cat, or the binding of a book. His favored form is that of a young boy with delicate elven features, brown skin, and curly hair, wearing a wool vest decorated with llamas, tree frogs, and snakes in his favored colors. This combination of green and yellow has become a stand-in for tricksters in tales told across the Inner Sea. Realistic replicas of toads and snakes are often made with these same favored colors, turning the pranks enacted by mischievous children into acts of worship.</p>\n<p>Jestercap, a holiday originally celebrated by Taldan gnomes, has become a feast day for Picoperi's worship.

Called the Ravenous King and Demon Lord of Beasts, he appears as an enormous and terrifying red-furred ape with six long fingers on each hand, massive and clawed. His red eyes, twisted horns, and viciously sharp fangs give him a demonic appearance. His followers range from gnolls to charau-kas to nalfeshnee demons that number in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Angazhan has astounding presence and influence, but that influence is rivaled by his raw power. He is skilled enough with weapons, but prefers to use his own abilities-his powerful fists, lethal fangs, sharp horns, and deadly tail. His terrible grasp extends beyond life into death, as well. Occasionally, those slain in combat by Angazhan's minions are reincarnated forcefully into an ape-like creature in the service of the Ravenous King. This curse causes the victim to serve eternally, and only upon death is there a chance for their soul to be retrieved before it slips into the Boneyard, to be sent on and suffer a never-ending torment in the Abyss.</p>\n<p>A pledge to Angazhan is a commitment to acquiring power. Angazhan encourages followers to destroy all who oppose them with relentless force, to dominate until nothing is left to challenge, and to treat obstacles as something to be crushed with swiftness. Those who fail these commands are quick to be cast aside. This strength lures dangerous figures, thievish creatures, and terrifying beings.

Roaming throughout the sky above Golarion, she delights in throwing her bolts into the fields and the minds of people, whenever conditions permit and wherever they may fall. Some believe the smoke from Lubaiko's fires are curses and misfortune flying up into the air to spread throughout the land. Yet Lubaiko's blazes also often clear the way for new growth.</p>\n<p>Though a dangerous god, Lubaiko has a playful, mischievous side, just as there is erratic beauty in dancing sparks and in the teasing whisper of a candle's flame. She loves men's clothing, the passion and tumult that flows with too much brandy, riotous jokes, and stories that make emotions run high. Her humor runs slightly on the sadistic side-she might set someone's sleeve aflame for the fun of it, or laugh hysterically at the bad luck of others, so long as no one (at least, who doesn't deserve it) gets too hurt. Though she had no involvement in the creation of gunpowder, she has likewise adopted it, delighting in burnt powder offerings, cannon salutes, and exploding kegs.</p>\n<p>Revolutionaries, inventors, artists, and arsonists alike offer Lubaiko prayers to help their achievements quickly spread. She has also been known to intervene and protect others from destructive strife, such as saving a particular orchid or homestead, though she's as likely to do so on a whim as out of acknowledgment for a desperate plea.

While she can be sadistic and even wantonly destructive, her Firebrand worshippers focus instead on her ambition and zeal, and they take inspiration from her willingness to spark change regardless of the cost. They find particular meaning in her edict to change the world, rallying around this call as they foment rebellion and turmoil or spread the thrill of daredevil antics throughout Golarion. Those Firebrands who are drawn to Lubaiko tend to be diehard adventurers and travelers, for the wandering god herself never stays put and proscribes anything like a sedentary life.</p>\n<p>Although Lubaiko is often blamed for bad luck and even attracts some worshippers who revel in the misfortunes of their enemies (or sometimes in their own), her Firebrand worshippers rarely acknowledge this aspect. Along with all Firebrands, they tend to be remarkably lucky themselves and benefit greatly from a cavalier attitude toward any potential for negative consequences. From Lubaiko, they take the cue to welcome the unexpected or unintended, making the most of situations that burn out of control, figuratively or literally. Among the Firebrands, her worship consists primarily of simple rituals and ceremonies, such as a quick prayer for favor while lighting a fire or setting off a charge of gunpowder. This flexibility and simplicity helps to spread her worship, as does the mischievous glee with which so many of her Firebrand worshippers invoke her name as they set forth on daredevil escapades or whip up a crowd.</p>\n<p>Firebrands who venerate Lubaiko don't feel the need to dress in particular ways or flaunt oversized religious symbols.

            "description": "<p>Throughout the Mwangi, there are few as highly respected as storytellers. As stewards of their peoples' oral traditions, they act as historians, educators, and entertainers, so it is only right that they pay homage to the goddess of stories, Grandmother Spider. Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider was once content in her role as weaver of fate for the gods, as it gave her the ability to craft the grandest tales anyone had ever known. But as she told story after story at the other gods' whims, they failed to show proper respect to the one who made their glorious and terrible legends come to pass, treating her as a servant or a tool. Grandmother had no patience for overinflated egos, and even less for those who take credit for the work of others. She crafted unique humiliations tailored to each of the gods, and as tales of her mischief spread, she wove her own divinity from them. Some of the more prideful gods deny her still-worshiping Grandmother Spider is forbidden by Asmodeus for as long as she still twirls copies of his keys around her fingers, and Abadar still holds a grudge since the Century of the Unbalanced Scale. To the north of the Mwangi, there are almost no shrines dedicated to Grandmother Spider. But the clever and willful always find ways to revere her.</p>\n<p>No matter how their pride might be wounded, few have dared to take direct action against Grandmother Spider. Alone, she is dangerous enough, for they say Nana Anadi holds all the secrets of the world within her web. However, her sibling Achaekek, the Red Mantis, is a force that even gods fear. Though he treats his sister with indifference, he once lashed out at someone who sought to do Grandmother Spider harm with disproportionate retribution. That one act has been more than enough.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider uplifts those who rebel against the status quo, strike above their station, or otherwise fight for freedom. While she prefers subterfuge and cleverness, she does not eschew violence, viewing it as simply another tool-applied judiciously in the right place at the right time, it can accomplish a great deal. Abolitionists and freedom fighters across Mwangi view spiders as an omen of good fortune. Those who are forced to live and fight in secret against their oppressors take great comfort in the knowledge that Nana Anadi will still tell their stories long after they are gone.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Grandmother Spider, also known as Nana Anadi, is a goddess of storytelling who once wove fate and reality into existence at the behest of other gods. She values independence, family, and cleverness, and despises when the unworthy hold power over others.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider's faith is exceedingly rare in Avistan, but it's incredibly strong in Garund. She's a favorite among Firebrands who chafe under authority, seek retribution against their oppressors, or operate through cleverness, guile, and stealth. Her followers tend to utilize clever plans, political maneuvering, and public humiliation over more violent methods of change. Once avenged, such Firebrands usually attempt to find others struggling under oppressive or incompetent rule and help them \"reweave fate\" by sparking revolution or governmental reform.</p>\n<p>Firebrands who worship Grandmother Spider tend to be serious, focusing on altruistic goals rather than personal accolades, fame, or wealth. They value stories and strive to remember the comrades they've lost, to learn from their mistakes and maintain their legacy beyond death. Many can inspire or manipulate others through stories or craft convincing lies, distractions, or illusions. Among the Firebrands, the most famous of Grandmother Spider's worshippers are Nana's Chosen, also referred to as the Spiteweft. Nana's Chosen are eight Firebrands who specialize in toppling tyrants, monarchs, bureaucrats, and other powerful leaders they deem \"undeserving\" through a series of increasingly ignominious public humiliations, usually involving the seeding of rumors; the exposure of secrets, betrayals, and weaknesses; manufactured public embarrassments; and proving their professional incompetence.</p>\n<p>Yet one need not devote one's life to Grandmother Spider to receive her aid, for the Weaver blesses all who question established hierarchies, usurp the status quo, or fight for freedom. Spiders are considered a good omen, as is the sight of a pristine spider's web or animals traveling in groups of eight. Those aiming to court her favor wear fabrics featuring diamonds or spiders, while those in need of subtlety or with little wealth to spare instead stitch a simple diamond into their clothes or paint a diamond upon their skin with paints or mud.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider is the patron goddess of the spider-like anadi people, said to have led them out of darkness and to freedom at some nebulous point in the ancient past. Thus, many Firebrands of other ancestries consider it good luck to work alongside an anadi and go out of their way to join a cell led by an anadi or recruit anadis to the Firebrands.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, enslave someone</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> family, illusion, stories, twilight, weaving</p>",

            "description": "<p>In the city-state of Mzali in the Mwangi Expanse resides an undead being of immense power, a child-sized god-king. In the past, Walkena was a mortal descendant of the gods that ruled over Mzali in ancient times, one of the sun kings from an old empire and a golden age of the city. Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali. When an army from the Sargavan city of Kalabuto attacked the city, Walkena awoke-this time as an undead creature-and slew each of the invaders in a purging rain of fire.</p>\n<p>Walkena is entirely different from how he was before his death. A sense of kindness and compassion was once common in his disposition, but after his revival he became controlling and unwavering. The young sun king previously embodied a gentle compassion; now he has become harsh like the summer sun. He purifies, but at a terrible cost.</p>\n<p>Walkena's stance is that all residents of the Mwangi Expanse are bonded, that they must all practice unity. Those whom associate and conspire with outsiders are traitors and a danger. Although his means are not always considered good, he will do anything to protect his people, so long as they do not defy him. To restore his homeland to the glory it once held is his greatest goal.</p>\n<p>Though cruel in his rule and terrifying to his enemies, for a long time, Walkena was one of the strongest points of resistance against colonial forces and the exploitation of the Mwangi Expanse. Many were reluctant to confront the child-god's abuses, fearful of criticizing one of the Mwangi people's most prominent defenders. Walkena's seeming disdain for the new nation of Vidrian has many worried that Walkena might be more harmful than helpful in the long run. Despite this, Walkena remains a compelling figure to many. His grace comes through in every action and word he speaks. He blesses those that have dedicated themselves to the Mwangi Expanse.

They look to Kurgess, the Strong Man, who was once a laborer himself, for aid in using their full potential, seeking to better themselves and encouraging others to strive toward their own potential, no matter their work. From Torag, they take the strength to be honorable and forthright and keep their word. And they look to Cayden Cailean not just for the strength to truly enjoy themselves when not working, but also to aid the oppressed. Recently, a small but growing number of followers, especially near Mzali, have been including Tlehar, too, as they seek the mental fortitude to give their best even as they hope each day will be better than the last. You'll find that these laborers won't cheat at honorable contests, swindle you, intentionally make anything subpar, or be mean or standoffish when drunk. Their religious observances tend to be frequent and regular but not at all fussy or lengthy. Ceremonies always seem to include food, drink, and games afterwards-or perhaps as part of the observances themselves.

For the Crimson Reclaimers, this means never forgetting the pain and trauma caused by the Whispering Tyrant in Lastwall, and channeling that grief into fuel for righteous revenge. Beyond these two major divine influences, three other deities represent values the followers of the pantheon hold dear. Gorum (Our Lord in Iron) preaches strength and victory in battle. Iomedae (The Inheritor) led the charge on many successful attacks against Tar-Baphon, so it's only natural that her legendary deeds, and sense of honor, justice, and valor speak to followers of Sorrow's Sword. Many consider Arazni (The Unyielding) to be a strong part of this pantheon, due to her edict to survive at all costs and her abhorrence for the creation of unwilling undead. Arazni's inclusion is complicated by Vildeis and Ragathiel's feelings about evil, which is why Arazni is not an official member of the pantheon among all followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> vengeance, reclaiming lost homelands, drawing strength from sorrow</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> avenge the wronged, destroy evildoers, lead the charge in battle, remember your community's history</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> cower from combat, forgive those who have committed grave offenses, abandon or deceive allies</p>",

She also taught the importance of what they protected, identifying the hearth and the home, as well as the right to self-determination and to solitude, as worthy of defense. She is said to have instilled in the amurruns their need for solitude and their esteem of imagination. A master teacher, she is depicted as a graying catfolk woman or a cat by the hearth fire, her large, gentle eyes full of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The tenets of Adanye's faith are few and flexible. She helps the curious and the wandering to retain their sense of self and their need to stay safe as they discover and grow. She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present-the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.</p>\n<p>Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods. Her worshippers often paint or sketch her holy symbol, a simple paw print in orange (or on an orange background), which is sometimes enhanced with sketched flames or another symbol of fire, in an inconspicuous cornerstone of a building or on a fallen log. Adanye has an affinity with Desna and with Shelyn, given their overlapping interests in dreamers and individualism.

The goddess's shipbound followers typically show their allegiance by wearing flowing sashes of blue and white or by having a butterfly or star tattooed on the back of their hand.

An older Firebrand might tell an errant first mark, \"Find your place in the sky\" or \"Watch whither you wander.\" Firebrand astrologers put particular weight on the transit of the planets, and they see comets and shooting stars as powerful omens.

To those that society can't punish, Kalekot is executioner, striking from the shadows and leaving bodies to rot on the ground. To those lost at night, Kalekot is a silent follower, a guardian from danger. Those few who have glimpsed him describe a figure with withered skin and a snake's twisting spine. He always conceals his features behind an eyeless mask, its mouth filled with serpent's teeth, each fang the size of an elephant's tusk.</p>\n<p>Only those who have seen the darkest aspects of the world understand Kalekot well enough to seek him out safely. For Kalekot does not spread fear for the joy of it-he spreads it to keep people alive. The world holds many places that should not be visited, many secrets that should never be spread, and many monsters that hide behind smiling faces. Fear keeps people wary and on guard. Fear keeps the childish and curious from seeking out trouble. And fear is the only deterrent that predatory creatures understand. Kalekot and his servants terrify the innocent, but they also stalk the guilty, reminding those who torment others that there will always be a reckoning.</p>\n<p>Kalekot is a cynic, who believes he must dirty his hands to keep the souls of others clean. Despite this, he despises those who maintain optimism through ignorance. He favors those who make others uncomfortable through no wrong of their own-those with disfigurements and deformities, the poor, the abused and victimized, taboo breakers, and the monstrous. He is known to watch over those of dual heritage, two-headed creatures, and twins. Some scholars believe Kalekot himself was once a twin, before he buried his double to seal them away for eternity.</p>\n<p>Kalekot has a deep love of wild plants; he brews liquid chocolate, coffee, and ciders from jungle fruit, and his priests often use such drinks in their rituals and spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> spread fear in others, hide dangerous secrets, shock the self-righteous, kill the guilty to protect the innocent</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have accepted power over, allow a victim to escape due to gloating, snivel before authority, shout</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p>When casting the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ckUOoqOM7Kg7VqxB]{Avatar}</em> spell, a worshipper of Kalekot gains the following additional abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Kalekot</strong> Speed 70 feet, ignore difficult terrain</p>\n<p>Melee <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> ivory fangs (fatal d10, reach 10 feet), Damage [[/r (6d6+6)[piercing]]] damage</p>\n<p>Ranged <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> whisper of unmaking (range 120 feet), Damage [[/r (6d6+3)[slashing]]] damage</p>",

As Apsu's prime purpose is the destruction of Dahak, few non-dragons take up his cause, although honourable humanoids with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time. They typically wear a gold dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot. Golarion lacks much of a centralized humanoid church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on the planet is known as the Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in Oppara and Absalom. Apsu is more widely worshiped by humanoids on the planet Triaxus, where he is the patron deity of the Dragon Legion. The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him. Instead, they hope to raise a grand army to offer Apsu when the time comes for him to fight Dahak.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Seek and destroy evil, travel the world, help others fend for themselves</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Fail to pursue a foe who has betrayed your mercy, attack a creature without certainty of wrongdoing</p>",

Ragdya spent much time in his younger days getting involved in the matters of the other Vudrani gods, giving rise to a repeating number of escapades featuring other deities such as Likha and Chamidu. In spite of his antics, Ragdya is much beloved, as he brings with him an infectious aura of mirth and excitement for all things in life.</p>\n<p>Yet, for all the joy, there's also sorrow, for Ragdya sits alone watching over his progeny, the vanaras, and his faithful. He offers rebirth so his followers might come to better know themselves with continued experience, but in so doing, he can't have the happiness of holding his children close. Still, he wishes them to know the joy of love, to experience how the power of laughter can bond them with others regardless of station, and to hold their sorrows at bay for just a moment more. He wants them to know that there's no shame in learning a lesson borne from failure, but rather great pride in true humility and in being able to work past the ego to instead find humor in all the silly stages of life.</p>\n<p>A common saying is that \"a Ragdyan tries anything at least once, and gladly tells you the story of how it went wrong at least twice.\" For his many rural followers, being a Ragdyan means being open to expanding their horizons when the chance arrives, even if they're unable to go out and adventure themselves. The church of the mountain sage can be found in a plethora of places, from grandstanding, intricate temples to small shrines in remote villages, to the corners of restaurants in big cities and to prominently placed altars in taverns, where people from all over can come together and exchange tales of their lives. No matter the location, there will always be a depiction of Bahmenu with the Sage sitting atop it, hoping for the faithful to bless the shrines with the sound of laughter.
