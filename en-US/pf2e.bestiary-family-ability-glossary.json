A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light.

A successful @Check[type:perception|dc:resolve(10+@actor.system.saves.reflex.value)] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Evil}</em>, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check.
