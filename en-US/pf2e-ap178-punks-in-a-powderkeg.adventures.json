To\n    exact revenge on the despicable mogul who destroyed their lives, the party must hotfoot around the grime-caked\n    streets of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ooalk01player.JournalEntryPage.01alkenstarcit00]{Alkenstar, The City of Smog}. As\n    the Game Master, you'll construct a scaffolding of riveting non-player characters, intricate plots, and electrifying\n    encounters upon which your players can craft stories of their characters' thrilling exploits. As they explore a vast\n    city of clockwork menaces and explosive drama, the party will take down brass-clad constructs, blast through steel\n    vaults, and harness their reputations as hardened rebels to save the day.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Using this Adventure Path</h1>\n  <p>\n    The three volumes of the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path include everything necessary to run a complete\n    Pathfinder campaign for characters from 1st to 10th level. Together with the\n    <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> and supplemental rules in the Pathfinder Reference Document (available online at\n    <a href=\"https://paizo.com/prd\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">paizo.com/prd</a>), each volume contains everything\n    necessary for you as the Game Master to run the Adventure Path, including the adventure itself, articles to enhance\n    the campaign's setting, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06powderkegpar00]{Adventure Toolbox}, which features new character rules options and creatures that appear throughout the adventure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To play in this campaign, each player should have a copy of the\n    <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> as well as the <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</em>, a free supplement\n    downloadable from <strong>paizo.com.</strong>\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Background</h1>\n  <p>\n    Amid the tangle of pipes, smokestacks, and bricks that congest Alkenstar's grimy manufacturing districts,\n    innovations bubble up from inventors' laboratories, chemists' private factories, and gunsmiths' workshops. Most\n    developments fizzle out like so much effervescence or otherwise elude containment from even the city's most\n    brilliant minds. Sometimes, however, a single spark of genius is so explosive that it can change the fate of an\n    entire city.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Such is the case for the eccentric but brilliant alchemist Vashon Gattlebee and his latest invention, an extremely\n    volatile liquid he's dubbed “pyronite.” No mere firecracker, this new instrument of destruction rivals the most\n    powerful bombardments in terms of sheer catastrophic potential, yet its size is relatively diminutive; it can\n    contain a hundred cannons' worth of energy in a tube no larger than a goblin's forearm. Never before has such a\n    powerful explosive existed in such a compact form. It's no exaggeration to claim that Gattlebee's invention promises\n    to shake the foundations of the known world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Gattlebee traces his interest in science and explosives back to a formidable childhood tragedy. When he was just a\n    boy, Gattlebee's father took him on a hunting trip in a relatively quiet region of the nearby Mana Wastes. Monsters,\n    bandits, and worse threatened the safety of Alkenstar, his father told him, so it would be important for Gattlebee\n    to know how to handle himself. On the second day of their expedition, their makeshift long-gun backfired, killing\n    Vashon's father instantly. Somehow, the boy made it back to Alkenstar in tattered, bloodstained clothes, but it took\n    many weeks before he could speak of what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Vashon never picked up a firearm or ventured beyond Alkenstar's walls again. He shut out the rest of the world and\n    entombed himself in his private quarters, where he read books, studied alchemy, and performed experiments from\n    sunrise late into the night. One might have expected the survivor of such a terrible accident to avoid munitions\n    altogether, but hardly a day passed without some contained explosion or planned calamity almost blasting Gattlebee's\n    closed door off its hinges. Few were surprised when, years later, young Gattlebee enrolled at Blythir College to\n    continue his scientific pursuits, vowing to someday develop a substance that would render gunpowder obsolete.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Chain Reaction</h2>\n  <p>\n    Gattlebee, now a middle-aged man, is one of Alkenstar's most famous recluses. He's regarded as a misunderstood\n    genius by his friends and a perfectly understood crackpot by his detractors. Years of quiet, patient work in front\n    of his alchemy bench have finally yielded an invention Gattlebee can be proud of—an explosive substance that he\n    believes could eventually replace traditional black powder and revolutionize technology as the world knows it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In its raw state, pyronite is a viscous semi-transparent gel prone to catastrophic combustion at the slightest bump.\n    Such volatile substances are not unknown on Golarion, but their unpredictable nature is exactly what makes such\n    concoctions so rare and unwieldy. Gattlebee's true breakthrough came when he discovered that he could stabilize the\n    chemical by mixing it with soda ash and a special type of white salt collected from the Spellscar Desert. Once it\n    was stabilized, Gattlebee could pack the pyronite compound into small paper spheres, cylinders, or boxes and\n    transport it with ease.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The alchemist recently presented his formula to the public for the first time at an exposition at his alma mater,\n    Alkenstar's esteemed Blythir College. Although he carefully determined the pyronite dosage for the demonstration—he\n    brought a pellet no larger than a pea—his calculations must have been off. What should've been a dose just large\n    enough to blow open an armoire-sized adamantine gun safe ended up leveling more than half of the college's largest\n    lecture hall. Miraculously, no one was harmed except for Gattlebee, who sustained a few scrapes and bruises while he\n    stoically looked over his bungled demo. To the nonplussed inventor, the minor wounds he suffered paled in comparison\n    to the disappointment of an experiment gone awry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In spite of the botched exhibit (or perhaps because of it), the “pyronite incident” left a powerful impression on\n    all the students, faculty, and entrepreneurs who witnessed it. Invitations for high-paying jobs and speaking\n    engagements flooded in for Gattlebee, who was ill-prepared for the sudden spotlight. Overwhelmed by the attention,\n    he retreated to his private lab in Steamhaven. As he'd done so many times before in his life, Gattlebee shut and\n    locked the door behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Two of the demonstration's attendees weren't content to let Gattlebee slip back into the shadows. Ambrost Mugland, a\n    powerful private financier, realized right away the destructive (and lucrative) potential of pyronite in\n    construction, war, or whatever other ventures he could stick his hands in. The mogul deduced that two wealthy buyers\n    resided in Alkenstar's own backyard: the warring wizard nations on either side of the Duchy's borders. If Mugland\n    could pit the nations of Geb and Nex against one another in a bidding war over the pyronite formula—or secretly sell\n    it to both of them—then he stood to make a veritable killing from the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The other attendee who set Gattlebee firmly in her sights was Foebe Dunsmith. Though she's known to most as the\n    popular yet insouciant owner of the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon, Dunsmith is, in fact, a high-ranking informant for\n    the Alkenstar government, and the pyronite showcase unsettled her to her core. Dunsmith informed Grand Duchess\n    Trietta Ricia of Gattlebee's invention and correctly speculated its potential to upend the already tenuous political\n    order in eastern Garund. Dunsmith knew that other Alkenstar power brokers, such as Mugland, would also have their\n    eyes on the pyronite formula and that any more public attention drawn to the matter would only complicate the\n    situation. So, with the grand duchess's blessing, Dunsmith set about looking for independent yet manipulatable\n    agents to help her secure the formula. Once the secrets of its creation were safe, Ricia could formulate a long-term\n    solution for pyronite's inevitable release into the wider world.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Clock's Ticking</h2>\n  <p>\n    To fulfill his scheme of stealing the pyronite formula, Ambrost Mugland has had to pull strings and call in favors\n    all across Alkenstar. The mogul has even gone into debt over the matter—an unconventional tack for the notorious\n    copper-pincher—so convinced is he that this all-in bet on pyronite will pay off.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Mugland's most expensive, but by far most useful, accomplice thus far has been a corrupt officer of the law, Deputy\n    Shieldmarshal Anjelique Loveless. Loveless has likewise committed everything she has to the pyronite plot; she cowed\n    dozens of low-ranking shieldmarshals into subservience, and she has called in favors with criminal gangs all around\n    Alkenstar. Her minions have dutifully killed off anyone Mugland or Loveless suspected of potentially upsetting their\n    schemes, even other Alkenstar elites who attended Gattlebee's exposition. Of course, the lowly saloon owner Foebe\n    Dunsmith, among others, fell far beneath Mugland's or Loveless's notices.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Mugland has already secured buyers for the formula: two revolutionaries from across Alkenstar's borders named Parsus\n    (a ghoulish necromancer from Geb) and Ibrium (a suave Nexian geomancer). Despite hailing from nations famously at\n    odds with one another, the two buyers seem to be working together. Mugland doesn't care about the details of their\n    plans for pyronite, though; he just needs to deliver the goods so he can get paid. Unfortunately for the would-be\n    weapons dealer, he hasn't been able to capture Gattlebee or the pyronite formula because the reclusive alchemist\n    hasn't left his home since the Blythir exposition. Breaking and entering might work, but Gattlebee is famously\n    unpredictable, and Mugland doesn't want to risk the alchemist accidentally blowing up his own lab (and, more\n    importantly, the pyronite formula) in an act of self-defense. Mugland has no choice, for now, but to simply wait for\n    Gattlebee to emerge from his domestic fortress.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Foebe Dunsmith and Grand Duchess Ricia also understand that this waiting game can't last forever, and they've caught\n    wind of Mugland's plot. The sooner they get Gattlebee and his formula to a safe, hidden location, the sooner they\n    can rest assured that pyronite won't fall into the wrong hands. Dunsmith needs to find some trustworthy\n    mercenaries—preferably ones who can keep a low profile, are blissfully unaware of the pyronite matter, and don't\n    mind rubbing elbows with some of Alkenstar's less-reputable power brokers—to get Gattlebee to safety. For this task,\n    she's applying a classic Alkenstar axiom: “A bullet for my enemy aims as true in any gun.”\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Volatile Situation</h2>\n  <p>\n    Dunsmith has selected a handful of rough-and-tumble outlaws who each bear a personal grudge against Ambrost Mugland\n    or Deputy Loveless. To see if these toughs can work together in pursuit of their shared revenge, she has organized a\n    heist targeting the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02goldtankrese00]{Gold Tank Reserve}, one\n    of Mugland's smallest investment operations. The firm caters primarily to small-time, white-collar crooks and\n    landowners who live off the sweat of others' brows by targeting ranchers, small businesses, and other vulnerable\n    Alkenstar citizens with high-interest loans and exploitative contracts. Taking down the enterprise wouldn't solve\n    everyone's problems right away, but it would send a definitive message to Mugland and those who support him. If\n    Dunsmith's mercenaries can pull off this bank job, she plans to involve them in her and the duchess's scheme to\n    secure Gattlebee and take down Mugland.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Robbing the Gold Tank won't be so easy, however. Mugland's associate, Deputy Loveless, has caught wind of the\n    party's plans and hopes to intercept the thieves along their getaway route. She and her fellow crooked\n    shieldmarshals aren't known for offering mercy or playing fair—in fact, they look forward to the opportunity to dole\n    out their own brand of cruel, wicked justice away from public eyes.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</h1>\n  <p>\n    Before running this Adventure Path, provide your players with copies of the\n    <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</em>, a free download from\n    <a href=\"https://paizo.com/\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">www.paizo.com</a>.

Their pursuit for revenge\n    ultimately puts them in the best position possible to save the city of Alkenstar from utter catastrophe. The Outlaws\n    of Alkenstar Adventure Path spans three volumes and takes player characters from 1st through 10th level.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Punks in a Powderkeg</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Vanessa Hoskins</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #178, Levels 1–3</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    To impress a mysterious patron who promises to help them get revenge against their rivals, the characters rob\n    Ambrost Mugland's illicit banking operation, the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02goldtankrese00]{Gold Tank Reserve}. Afterward, the humble\n    bartender Foebe Dunsmith reveals that she's actually an informant for Alkenstar's grand duchess. She then gives the\n    mercenaries their next mission: protect the famous alchemist Vashon Gattlebee from kidnappers while escorting him\n    across the city to safety.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Two street gangs waylay the party and attempt to abscond with Gattlebee. The Clearwater Cleaners are obviously\n    working for Mugland, but the Powderkeg Punks' motives are a mystery. After they get Gattlebee to a safehouse, the\n    characters' investigation reveals that Gattlebee's small-time rival, Shoma Lyzerius, paid the Punks to apprehend\n    Gattlebee. To put a stop to the renegade alchemist's schemes, the characters track down Lyzerius in the ramshackle\n    district of Hellside.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Cradle of Quartz</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Scott D. Young</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #179, Levels 4–7</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    Foebe Dunsmith hires the characters to locate a priest of Brigh named Olomon Kosowana, who has somehow\n    reverse-engineered the dangerous explosive called pyronite. When they get to Kosowana's home, they find the priest's\n    clockwork laboratory already ransacked. Fortunately, Kosowana had enough time to leave a clue for the characters to\n    track him down at the Cradle of Quartz, a remote shrine to Brigh in the middle of the Spellscar Desert.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After arranging for an ill-fated airship journey to the desert and surviving the wasteland's strange cosmic horrors,\n    the characters rescue Kosowana from the malevolent inhabitants of the Cradle of Quartz. The outlaws then learn from\n    the priest that their rival, Ambrost Mugland, has gotten hold of Kosowana's recipe for pyronite and that he hired a\n    gang called the Gilded Gunners to test it at the Steaming Kingdom, a rival business owner's exclusive speakeasy. The\n    characters stop the assault then use their clues to finally track down Mugland and get their revenge once and for\n    all. Before his fate is sealed, Mugland reveals that he has already sold the formula to a pair of renegades from\n    Alkenstar's neighboring nations.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">The Smoking Gun</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Cole Kronewitter</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #180, Levels 8–10</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia herself approaches the characters and explains that the pyronite situation has become\n    dire. Unless the party can locate Deputy Loveless and Mugland's pyronite buyers before they use the bombs, the\n    safety of all of Alkenstar is threatened. The outlaws' best lead takes them to the Gunworks far west of Alkenstar,\n    where they learn more about the pyronite buyers—a necromancer from Geb named Parsus and a Nexian geomancer named\n    Ibrium—and their potential plot to level Alken Falls using pyronite.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The outlaws infiltrate the Tinwound Hydroforge at Alken Falls, where Parsus has used necromantic powers to fill the\n    water purification plant with undead minions. The necromancer has cleared the place for Ibrium and Loveless to load\n    it full of pyronite. Once defeated, Parsus explains that Ibrium and Loveless are on an inbound luxury riverboat,\n    pyronite in hand.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To save the day, the outlaws board a casino boat called\n    <em>The Gearsmoke</em> as it cruises down the Ustradi River. They sneak about the vessel to disarm the pyronite and\n    defeat Deputy Loveless and Ibrium, upending the villains' plot once and for all.\n  </p>\n</div>"

To evade capture at the hands of the corrupt shieldmarshals who work for Mugland’s ally,\n    Deputy Anjelique Loveless, the party must race to the nearby Wailing Scrapyard. Only by surviving the hazards and\n    monsters of this massive junkyard can the party hope to reach safety back at the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon.\n  </p>\n  <p> </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Magic in Alkenstar</h1>\n  <p>\n    The so-called City of Smog lies in the heart of the Mana Wastes, a fickle wasteland desert where magic doesn’t\n    always function as planned. In Outlaws of Alkenstar, the unpredictable nature of magic is presented during several\n    set encounters—particularly in the Mana Wastes in the second and third volumes—and characters are made aware in\n    advance whenever such circumstances might arise. For the most part, however, magic works normally in nearly every\n    encounter. If you and your group are interested in making unreliable magic a larger part of your campaign, consider\n    using the rules for wellspring magic (<em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em> 248) or leaning into the concepts of\n    Bronzetime and Surgetime while in Alkenstar (sidebar on page 51).\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  As the nearly endless arcane wars between the nations of Nex and Geb devastated the very land itself, magic became\n  unreliable within the realm of the wizards’ conflict. It became a vast, ravaged desert named the Mana Wastes. Few now\n  tread there on purpose, for the creatures that have survived in the wasteland are bizarre and powerful. Yet amid this\n  dusty cradle, a settlement of inventors, alchemists, and survivalists constructed a haven for their unorthodox ideas\n  and creations. They developed technology to rival the most powerful spellcasters by harnessing clockwork, primordial\n  steam engines, black powder, and the secrets of alchemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Now, in the soot-covered city of Alkenstar, the largest settlement in the Mana Wastes, industry and innovation\n  continue to abound. The wealthy citizens of Skyside harness the erratic but potent magical energies all around them to\n  create colossal constructs, mighty horrors of wood and iron, and weapons of dire portent. Meanwhile, in the\n  smog-shrouded neighborhoods of Smokeside, gunsmiths forge firearms of exquisite beauty, toxic ammunition that defies\n  logic, and armor capable of withstanding the gruesome armaments. Throughout the entire city, inspiration and\n  innovation fuel a vast industry of thunderous technology, explosive discoveries, and cataclysmic powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The race for finding the strongest weapon creates fierce competition between factions both legitimate and illicit.\n  Power shifts to whomever claims control over the newest innovation, and patrons are willing to pay top dollar for\n  inventors able to produce results. Occasionally, an inventor or alchemist devises something so dangerous and volatile,\n  it threatens to topple the balance of power completely.\n</p>\n<p>This is one of those moments.</p>\n<p>\n  The genius inventor Vashon Gattlebee recently demonstrated the destructive power of his latest invention, a potent new\n  form of explosive called pyronite. Alkenstar’s greatest minds are abuzz with the potential applications for this\n  fascinating new technology, from terraforming to warfare. Gattlebee has thus far refused to sell his invention or\n  share its secrets with any of the many potential patrons who now court him, but there are powers at play who simply\n  won’t take no for an answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While nobles and weapons dealers strive for a contract with Gattlebee, the ruler of Alkenstar, Grand Duchess Trietta\n  Ricia, is trying to stop the invention’s spread before it’s too late. She knows a power like this threatens to shake\n  the foundations of Garund, perhaps all Golarion, if it falls into the wrong hands. One such pair of hands belongs to\n  Ambrost Mugland, a ruthless financier who would gladly sell the formula to both Nex and Geb, hoping to double his\n  profits. With the aid of his right-hand ally, the infamously corrupt shieldmarshal Deputy Anjelique Loveless,\n  Mugland’s schemes spell doom for both neighboring nations—to say nothing of the city caught in the crossfire.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Though the grand duchess can’t act directly without politically dirtying her hands, she can work through an agent.\n  She’s asked Foebe Dunsmith, a local saloon owner and staunch ally, to arrange for the protection of Gattlebee and to\n  keep a lid on his formula. Dunsmith has just the crew in mind: a band of outlaws who have little love for Ambrost\n  Mugland or Deputy Loveless, but she needs to test their mettle first—and earn some silver while she’s at it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In “Punks in a Powderkeg,” the characters learn about the looming threat of pyronite and work for Alkenstar’s\n  government to keep the secret formula out of the wrong hands.\n</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Getting Started</h1>\n<p>\n  The characters begin this adventure in the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon. They’ve all been lured here by Foebe Dunsmith,\n  the smooth-talking, gun-slinging proprietor who’s promised to help the party get revenge on their mutual enemies.\n  Players can find specific hooks and backgrounds to tie their characters into this Adventure Path—including a reason\n  why they’ve shown up at the saloon tonight—in the free\n  <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ooalk01player.JournalEntryPage.01howtousethis00]{Player’s Guide}</em> supplement on\n  <a href=\"https://paizo.com\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">paizo.com</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With her help, Dunsmith has promised the characters they can hit Ambrost Mugland where it hurts him most—the wallet.\n  She’s invited the party to the bar tonight to enjoy this week’s episode in a serial of plays titled\n  <em>Hearts at High Noon</em>. After the show, she’ll gather the outlaws in one of the saloon’s back rooms where they\n  can discuss the details of the job she has to offer them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you’re ready to start the adventure, read or paraphrase the following text aloud to set the scene and give the\n  players an opportunity to introduce their characters to one another. Alternatively, you could start the characters on\n  the steps of the Gold Tank Reserve and have each of them\n</p>\n<p>reflect on the circumstances of getting this job using a flashback (see the Straight to the Action sidebar).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Straight to the Action</h1>\n  <p>\n    Especially for new players, the free-form nature of this adventure’s opening scene can be quite intimidating.\n    Players might overthink their plan or get overwhelmed by the sheer number of possibilities open to them. If you\n    think your group would benefit from cutting straight to the action, consider simply starting the adventure right in\n    front of the Gold Tank Reserve instead. In this case, you can still give the party an opportunity to discuss their\n    mission with Dunsmith—simply present this conversation as a brief flashback.\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “Draw.” Bang! A crack of thunder fills the air. The smoking gun, held by a powerfully built orc man wearing leather\n    chaps, vest, and a shiny sheriff’s badge, holds everyone’s attention. The orc slowly lowers the firearm, stowing it\n    back in his holster. He carefully and deliberately walks up to a bloody dwarf, surveying his handiwork.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “I’m sorry it had to go down this way, brother. You picked the wrong side and that I can’t abide.” He removes his\n    pinched-front hat, holding it over his heart. After a moment, he lowers his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The entire saloon erupts in applause as the pianist begins to play. The orc bows deeply, then helps the dwarf to his\n    feet, who also bows to the attending patrons. The two walk to the bar, arm in arm, and order a bottle of whiskey.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Thank you for attending!” A female dwarf stands on the bar top, addressing the patrons in a loud voice. “Whiskey is\n    only two silver for the next hour, and that includes top shelf. Come back next week for the conclusion of Hearts at\n    High Noon and our after-party! Enjoy yourselves!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The dwarven woman, Foebe Dunsmith, hops off the bar onto the sawdust-covered floor and heads to a back room, where a\n    round table and private bar await. She props one foot up on a stool, leans forward on her knee, and casts a\n    suspicious eye around the room. “Now that the show is over, let’s talk business. I brought you all here because we\n    share some common enemies. With your help, I can make them pay—and get you rich in the process. But first, I want\n    you to tell me why you deserve a job that could pay your weight in gold.”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Ask each of your players to introduce their characters to the rest of the group. Players can share as much or little\n  as they like about their characters, including the backgrounds they may have selected from the\n  <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player’s Guide</em>. One thing every character should have in common is a grudge held toward\n  either the cutthroat mogul Ambrost Mugland or the corrupt shieldmarshal Deputy Anjelique Loveless.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the characters have been introduced, Dunsmith offers to pour a round of drinks and calls for food. She then\n  explains why she’s brought them all here today: to pull off a robbery at one of Mugland’s banks.\n</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “Here’s the game,” Dunsmith says. “Ambrost Mugland has a decent portion of his funds invested in an old bank called\n    the Gold Tank Reserve. It’s a rundown temple of Abadar in Ironside Quarter that’s mostly used by ranchers and\n    crooked politicians. I happen to know they’ve sent half their clockwork handlers out for maintenance and won’t have\n    them back until tomorrow afternoon. This is our chance to hit Mugland where it hurts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “All you have to do is bust up the few clockworks remaining, get the vault key from the bank manager, and fill a\n    sack with gold. Once you’re done inside the bank, run out the back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Mugland’s got a few crooked shieldmarshals on his payroll—including that damn bastard, Deputy Loveless. She and her\n    goons are sure to be hot on your tail, but don’t fight ‘em: they’ll gun you down in a second if you give them the\n    chance. Just run away and they’ll look like fools. Nothing’s sure to fry the deputy’s egg like crooks she can’t\n    catch, trust me. You can lose them in the Wailing Scrapyard just west of the Reserve. There’s a sewer entrance\n    within; from there, it’s a straight shot back to this saloon, where you’ll be safe. Any questions?”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  The characters can ask Dunsmith for more details about the job, working out any doubts or details of their plan. Below\n  are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and Dunsmith’s responses.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_PORTRAIT_FINAL.webp\" alt style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_PORTRAIT_FINAL.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  <strong>What’s our cut? </strong>“Ten percent each. I keep the rest to cover costs and fund the next part of our plan\n  to take down Mugland.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Will there be innocent people in the bank? </strong>“When it comes to Mugland’s businesses, nobody’s innocent.\n  That said, best to not go killing anybody or taking hostages. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind taking his\n  ‘investors’ down a notch too, but I can’t abide working with a crew of marauders as wicked as the devil himself.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What’s the next part of the plan to take down Mugland/Loveless? </strong>“First, I have to know I can trust\n  you. Let’s just do this job and we’ll get to the next.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you have against Mugland?</strong> “Besides him being a greedy son-of-a-gun who doesn’t care who he\n  steps on? Oh, I’ve got plenty of my own reasons.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How are we supposed to get in the vault?</strong> “It should be open during business hours. The inside gate’ll\n  be locked, but the bank manager, a Mugland crony named Dresh, has the keys.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How do we get into the bank?</strong> “Through the front door, I’d reckon. If you could get a key from one of\n  the staff, you could even go in the back. There’s an employee entrance in the alley that connects to the junkyard.\n  That’s how you make your escape.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How many clockwork handlers should we expect?</strong> “Usually there’s half a dozen clockworks, Baalkirk\n  Model C-47s. But most of them are out on maintenance, so get in there before tomorrow afternoon, before they’re\n  returned.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Who is Deputy Loveless?</strong> “A crooked officer; she’s in Mugland’s pocket and does his dirty work, all in\n  the name of the law. If you see a half-elf with blue-black hair and death in her eyes, run. She’s a crack shot with a\n  bad attitude—she don’t miss and she don’t leave witnesses.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What can you tell us about the Wailing Scrapyard?</strong> Dunsmith shrugs. “Haunted,” she says before\n  throwing back the remainder of her whiskey.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you mean “haunted?!”</strong> “Look, there’s a rumor it’s haunted. It’s probably just the\n  Nailgobblers, though. They live in the heaps. If you need to resupply while you’re there, you can probably trade with\n  them—they’re friendly enough. But if they offer you anything to eat, don’t look at it too closely. Just hold your nose\n  and swallow.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What should we expect in the sewer?</strong> “Sewer’ll be the least of your worries. Get a map from the\n  Nailgobblers and you’ll be back here sippin’ whiskey with me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the characters have asked all their questions, Dunsmith gives them a\n  <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.jaEEvuQ32GjAa8jy]{Bag of Holding (Type I)}</em>, which they can use to stow the\n  stolen gold, plus a <em>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.fvpLYx1Lo42cdleQ]{Hat of Disguise}</em> for each character.\n  “Here’s a few things you might be able to use. Keep the pouch and put all of the gold in it, you hear? Otherwise it’ll\n  slow you down. Put on the hats so you can keep your identities secret, but don’t muss ‘em up—I’ll be wanting them back\n  when you’re done.” Thereafter, she excuses herself from the table and heads back to the saloon, leaving the characters\n  alone to plot their mission.\n</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Planning the Heist</h1>\n<p>\n  The party has a little less than a day to pull off this heist, otherwise they’ll be up against significantly more\n  clockwork handlers. This gives them a chance to case the area, ask around about the bank or scrapyard, or perform\n  other preparations. Each of these activities takes roughly 2 hours to complete and there’s only 12 hours until the\n  bank opens the next morning, which is the last opportunity the characters have to execute the robbery. If a character\n  gets fewer than 8 hours of rest, they’re fatigued the next day. If they get fewer than 4 hours of rest, they’re\n  exhausted.\n</p>"

We have a\n    deal?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The characters have a chance to talk with Lord Glass, clearing up what the Nailgobblers want and gleaning some\n    information about the scrapyard and its denizens. Below are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and Lord\n    Glass’s responses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What do you want us to do?</strong> Lord Glass eyes you uncertainly, perplexed. He annunciates each word as\n    he slowly replies, “Make. Gnolls. Go. Away... We. Give. You. Gift.” He turns to a nearby goblin and loudly whispers,\n    “I didn’t expect smart mercenaries, but did Pogi find ones who can’t even remember what we hired them for?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Why do you think we know this already? </strong>“Huh? Didn’t Pogi send you? We sent our envoy into the city\n    days ago to find mercenaries to take out the gnolls. We thought Pogi was so successful, you beat him here.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What can you tell us about these gnolls? </strong>“They come to our scrapyard and attack us. They attack\n    longshanks, too. The shieldmarshals think we attack longshanks, accuse us of killing them. But why would we kill\n    when we have so much good scrap around? Makes no sense. All to say: These murderers are bad for business.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Where are the gnolls?</strong> “North, over the wall. We put up sharp metal to keep them out, blocked their\n    way with the old ship, the big metal box. We shut them out, but they’re still there. Go, make them gone! The easiest\n    way for longshanks to get there is to go east, around the big metal box and the old ship.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What do we get for defeating the gnolls? </strong>“Best junk—secret junk we don’t usually sell to\n    longshanks. Rare metal.” Lord Glass smiles wide, his teeth chipped and sharp.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s this about an old ship? </strong>“Big flying ship.” Lord Glass says, gesturing in a sweeping overhead\n    motion. “Crashed here long ago. We used the crane to knock it down, block the gnolls. Heard a loud scream when we\n    pushed it down. Must have old captain inside... or a ghost.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s this about a metal box?</strong> “Big metal container. We used the crane to move it, block the path.\n    The gnolls can’t get past it—too heavy, too smooth to climb.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What about a crane?</strong> “Big old crane, to the east. Move the levers, the crane moves around the\n    scrapyard. Monsie knows how to fix it when it breaks down. Monsie’s smart, only Nailgobbler who knows how to fix\n    things like that.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What can you tell us about the scrapyard? </strong>“Scrap City is our home,” Lord Glass says proudly. The\n    other goblins bow their heads, their hearts full of pride. “Lots of junk to sell, lots of bugs to eat. Lots of rust,\n    too—Monsie knows how to make a tasty drink with the rust. We miss Monsie. She went to fight the gnolls but hasn’t\n    come back. Let us know if you see Monsie.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Is the scrapyard really haunted?</strong> “Ha! No. We make sounds to scare off longshanks who want our junk.\n    But also, yes. We heard a ghost once. That was how we got the idea to scare off longshanks.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Who is Monsie?</strong> “She’s the smartest Nailgobbler of all, an inventor. She makes lots of things:\n    bombs, yummy drinks, tools, foot crank for the fire pit. She went to fight the gnolls but hasn’t come back. We fear\n    the worst. Please find her. Please tell us she’s okay. We miss Monsie.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After the characters have concluded their conversation with Lord Glass, he offers them room and board in the\n    Nailgobblers’ encampment should they need to rest. Most of the food consists of vermin trapped and then cooked or\n    pickled—smoked rat, pickled rat, and deep-fried cockroaches. This is an appropriate place for the characters to take\n    an 8-hour rest if they need to.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award and Treasure:</strong> If the characters drive away the gnolls in areas <strong>B8</strong> and\n    <strong>B10</strong>, they can return to Lord Glass for a reward. He gifts the characters a cold iron chunk. Each\n    character earns 30 XP.\n  </p>"

She’s a cold-blooded killer firmly embedded in Mugland’s pocket. She’s one of his favorite assassins not\n    just because she’s got the law on her side, but because she’s a crack shot, too.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Has anyone come looking for us?</strong> If the characters used the <em>hats of disguise </em>during the\n    robbery she replies, “Nah, and I reckon they won’t so long as you didn’t say nothing about me or the saloon.” If\n    they didn’t use the <em>hats</em> she replies, “Well, I lent you those hats for a reason. Don’t worry, you can lay\n    low here for a few days ‘til it all blows over.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When do we get our next job?</strong> “Hungry for more, eh? Well, now that I know you can work together and\n    produce results, I have just the job in mind. We can start in four days, or sooner if you’re able.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the characters are done asking Dunsmith questions, read or paraphrase the following aloud to conclude this\n    chapter with a startling revelation about their employer.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"read-aloud\">\n    <p>\n      Dunsmith swirls the dregs of her whiskey in her glass, downs the drink, and stands. She unholsters her shotgun in\n      one fluid motion, then sets the firearm on the bar counter. “Well now,” she says in a low voice. “I suddenly have\n      a lot of dirt on each of you, don’t I? Armed robbery, obstruction of justice, evading the law. Quite a rap sheet.”\n      She leans against the bar and stretches casually. “I guess this means I should tell you something about me. I’m\n      not just a saloon owner, for starters.” She removes her holster and sets it on the bar next to her shotgun. “In\n      fact, I work for a very powerful person, someone you’re no doubt familiar with.” She puts one hand in her vest,\n      palms something, and extends her closed hand. It’s a small signet ring that exhibits the distinctive symbol of the\n      Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. “Does Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia ring a bell? Yeah, I thought so.” Dunsmith can hardly\n      contain her smirk, enthralled with her own theatrics. “What this means is,” she sighs, drawing out the words,\n      “since you work for me, you actually work for the grand duchess.” She laughs, her cool façade finally cracking,\n      then slips the ring back into her pocket.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “What?

The\n    characters have rejoined their patron, Foebe Dunsmith, in the back room of\n    the Barrel &amp; Bullet so Dunsmith can explain their next mission. Now that\n    she knows the characters can get a job done and has told them who they’re\n    truly working for—the government of Alkenstar—she hires them for a very\n    special job: escort the famous inventor Vashon Gattlebee to safety.\n  </p>\n  <p>Once the party is ready to proceed, read or paraphrase the following.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n  <div class=\"read-aloud\">\n    <p>\n      Foebe Dunsmith paces around the Barrel &amp; Bullet’s back room as she\n      talks. She’s animated and enthusiastic, clearly firing on all cylinders\n      and still reveling in the success of the Gold Tank Reserve heist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “For this next job,” Dunsmith says, “the duchess has asked us to secure\n      some very precious cargo.” She slides a broadsheet across the table: a\n      poster advertising “Vashon Gattlebee’s Pyronite Exhibition” at Blythir\n      College. The poster includes a woodprint of a harried human man in his\n      fifties—presumably Gattlebee—and some hyperbolic copy promoting the\n      “once-in-a-lifetime explosive showcase.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “I’m sure you’ve all heard of Gattlebee and his pyronite, yeah?” Dunsmith\n      asks. “Talk of the town ever since he leveled half of Blythir’s largest\n      auditorium. Well, Gattlebee’s invention has gotten him a lot of admirers\n      recently. Everyone in Alkenstar wants a piece of the man, or at least a\n      piece of his new invention. Thankfully for us, Gattlebee’s turned down\n      everyone who’s offered to hire him on or buy the pyronite formula from\n      him. He’s been able to hold off his prospectors from the safety of his own\n      home so far, but he can’t hold down that puny brick-and-mortar fortress\n      forever.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Fortunately, the grand duchess and I have managed to convince Gattlebee\n      he’d be better off here, in the saloon’s workshop, where no one will know\n      his location. He’s game, and now we just need to get him from point A to\n      point B.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “That’s where you come in. We need you to meet Gattlebee at his home on\n      the other side of the city and bring him back to the Barrel &amp; Bullet.\n      Once he’s here, I can keep him safe. Simple enough job, right? Go get\n      Gattlebee and bring him back here. I’m paying you fifty gold apiece to\n      bring him back in one piece.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Dunsmith pinches the bridge of her nose like she’s just remembered\n      something unpleasant. “Oh yeah. As part of our arrangement, Gattlebee made\n      us promise that he’d be able to make a stop along the way here. Near\n      Ironside Quarter at some abandoned brewery. Got me why, but that’s the\n      deal: stop at a place called ‘Yeast of All Brewery’ once you’ve got\n      Gattlebee. Besides, it might be a good place to lay low if you need to\n      catch your breath.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Anyway. We don’t have much time to get this done. Mugland and Loveless\n      are likely to make a grab for Gattlebee soon. Mugland’s been moving money\n      around and paying off some shady folk. By my estimations, we have about\n      four days to get to Gattlebee before our cargo is compromised.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Be ready for Mugland’s mercenaries, Loveless’s street gangs, or anyone\n      else under our rivals’ thumbs.” Dunsmith pulls a rolled-up map of\n      Alkenstar from a nearby shelf and unfurls it across table. “You should\n      scout your route before you pick up Gattlebee, just to make sure it’s\n      safe.” She then removes her cameo brooch and sets it on top of the map.\n      “Show this to Gattlebee so he knows you’re working for me.”\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Give your players a blank copy of the map of Alkenstar on the inside back\n    cover of this volume. The players can use this map throughout the rest of\n    the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path to mark important locations or to\n    coordinate their plans.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The characters can ask Dunsmith questions about the grand duchess,\n    Gattlebee, or their mission to escort the inventor to the Barrel &amp;\n    Bullet. Following are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and\n    Dunsmith’s responses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Why do you work for Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia? </strong>“We go\n    back a long time. Before she was even in politics, if you can believe it.\n    Anyway, I do her a lot of favors. It’s no secret among rulers that you can’t\n    accomplish everything with decrees and signatures and tariffs. Sometimes,\n    you need someone to get their hands dirty on the ground floor. That’s where\n    I—and now you—come in.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What if I don’t want to work for the grand duchess?</strong> “Just\n    consider it working for me. Look, this is going to ruin all of Mugland’s\n    plans. You want to ruin him good? You want to take this job.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>How will this help us get revenge on Mugland/Loveless? </strong>“Mugland and Loveless desperately want the formula for pyronite, no doubt\n    for some shady back room deal they’re hoping to make. So far, they haven’t\n    left a shred of evidence about their plans, but it’s only a matter of time\n    until they slip up. When that happens, you’ll have your chance to make\n    things right, whatever that means to you. In the meantime, we’ve got to make\n    sure\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    neither of them achieves their goals, which is why we have to get Gattlebee\n    to safety.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s the big deal with pyronite?</strong>\n    <strong>Why does Mugland want it?</strong> “Clearly, you didn’t see the\n    demonstration. Gattlebee blew up an entire building, practically, with a\n    dose of the stuff no bigger than a musket ball. Everyone wants to get a\n    piece of it—for war, industry, you name it. Mugland is a businessman, so his\n    interests are purely financial. He intends to sell it, that much is certain.\n    We’re just not sure to whom.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What does the grand duchess of Alkenstar want with pyronite?</strong>\n    “Honestly? To bury it. Having that stuff out in the world is just too\n    dangerous. If it falls into the wrong hands, a whole lot of people are going\n    to get hurt. Gattlebee’s been too wrapped up in the work itself to see how\n    much potential his invention has to destroy lives. Thankfully, that’s the\n    same reason why he hasn’t sold it; he cares more about getting pyronite\n    right than making a profit. The best thing we can do is get Gattlebee\n    somewhere safe so he can continue his research well away from anyone who\n    wants to steal it.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What should we expect from Gattlebee?</strong> “He’s harmless,\n    explosive grains of sand notwithstanding. Bit of a shut-in recently, of\n    course, and he’s whip-smart when it comes to keeping intruders out of his\n    home, so watch your step. He knows about our arrangement to get him to\n    safety, but he’s always neck-deep in his work, and he forgets just about\n    anything that isn’t written in his formula book. Don’t be surprised if the\n    door’s locked when you get there. Shoot, he might not even remember it’s the\n    day you’re coming!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Any recommendations on how to get him back here?</strong> “You\n    should scout your route between Steamhaven and Ferrous Quarter before you\n    pick up the cargo. There’s no good sewer access between here and there, so\n    you’ll have to bring him overland, through the city. You’ll run into\n    trouble, no doubt about it—goons hired by Mugland, for sure. You should be\n    able to catch your breath at Yeast of All Brewery before completing the\n    final leg of the trip.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the characters have finished asking Dunsmith questions, she wishes them\n    luck and returns to tending bar. The characters have some downtime to rest\n    and prepare for their mission.\n  </p>"

One\n    <em>shrinking potion</em> is nestled among dozens of unlabeled vials, beakers, and flasks scattered about\n    Gattlebee’s lab. Based on his offhanded description of the potion (“greenish-yellow-blue, kinda bubbly,” he grunts\n    from his bedroom), a character must succeed at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20|traits:action:seek|name:Seek] check to\n    Seek to find the potion by sight alone. Alternatively, a character can spend 3 actions to thoughtfully test the most\n    likely potions and make a @Check[type:crafting|dc:16|name:Find shrinking potion] check. Either way, on a success, a\n    character locates the <em>shrinking potion</em> necessary to counteract Gattlebee’s growth serum.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finding the potion may be the easy part; getting the panicked lizard to ingest the liquid is another matter\n    entirely. A character trained in alchemical bombs can make a ranged Strike against Slick (AC 18) to throw the potion\n    into the lizard’s mouth; if a character Readies this Strike and designates Slick’s tongue Strike as the trigger, the\n    character gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A character who can’t throw bombs can get the potion into Slick’s mouth if the lizard becomes grabbed or restrained.\n    To do so, the character holding the potion must be adjacent to Slick and must succeed at a\n    @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:18|name:Force Feed] or @Check[type:athletics|dc:18|name:Force Feed] check. At your\n    discretion, characters can employ other creative ideas or tactics to get Slick to drink the potion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In any case, a failed attack or check causes the potion to land in a nearby space, while a critical failure causes\n    the potion to break and spill all over the floor, rendering it useless. (A character adjacent to Slick can spend a\n    reaction to attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:17|name:Catch Potion] save to catch a potion on a failed or critically\n    failed attempt, preventing the potion from breaking.) A success means Slick ingests the potion and shrinks to normal\n    size after 1 round. On a critical success, the effects are immediate, and Slick instantly reverts to his usual size.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the characters subdue Slick without killing him, he reverts to his normal size after 5 minutes. Gattlebee thanks\n    the characters and rewards them with the items listed under Treasure, below. If Slick dies, Gattlebee’s attitude\n    toward the characters changes to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.I1ffBVISxLr2gC4u]{unfriendly}, and he doesn’t offer\n    them the below items to help with their mission.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Treasure:</strong> If the characters leave Slick alive, Gattlebee offers the party a bundle of helpful\n    alchemical items. He gives the party three lesser tanglefoot bags, two moderate thunderstones, five lesser\n    antidotes, a moderate cognitive mutagen, and two minor elixirs of life. If the characters killed his pet, Gattlebee\n    gruffly gives the party only the two minor elixirs of life.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> For subduing Slick or reducing his size without killing him, award each character 30 XP.\n  </p>"

Though the brewery\n  goes up for auction soon, a group of adventurers temporarily settled in the abandoned building before they set off\n  again. The seven wanderers call themselves the Iron Hunters. They’re a mix of humans and dwarves who, each for their\n  own reason, live on the city’s fringes, where they hunt monsters, search ruins for treasure, and generally get by as\n  urban adventurers. When shieldmarshals or other organizations in Alkenstar seek specialists in city adventuring, urban\n  exploration, or underworld politicking, they often call upon the aid of groups such as this.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_SQUATTER.webp\" alt=\"An older man with a tanned complexion, generous grey beard, and goggles around his head.\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_SQUATTER.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  The Iron Hunters are led by a skilled forager originally hailing from Nex named <strong>Kasali</strong> (LN male human\n  trapper 1). Kasali was once a skilled wizard in the Nexian military, but he abandoned his post many years ago and fled\n  to Alkenstar. In a city where spellcraft is often unreliable, Kasali’s magical knack was much less useful, but he\n  found pride and a sense of community in the ruins of Ironside Quarter. Like Kasali, the rest of the Iron Hunters don’t\n  maintain a neat appearance by design; clean faces and fresh clothes stand out against the gray and brown grime of\n  western Alkenstar. The last thing Kasali and his crew want to do while hunting monsters is stand out.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The septet gathered most of the food and useful tools from the Yeast of All Brewery. They intended to depart soon, but\n  they’ve gotten in something of a bind. Kasali’s second-in-command, a clockworks expert named\n  <strong>Bolsa</strong> (LN nonbinary dwarf tinker 1), reactivated the clockwork brewers in area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17803runand.JournalEntryPage.03tastingroom000]{D1}</strong> to take them on as\n  mechanical minions, but Bolsa couldn’t fix the brewers’ malfunctioning hardware, which causes them to attack anyone on\n  sight. Worse, the two clockworks are able to wind each other up, meaning they’ll remain a danger to anyone who enters\n  the taproom until the clockworks are destroyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kasali found a set of spare keys when they first arrived, allowing the adventurers to leave through the bay doors in\n  this area and lock up after themselves. After Bolsa discovered some aggressive wasps in the work area (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17803runand.JournalEntryPage.03workroom000000]{D4}</strong>), they locked that room as\n  well for everyone’s safety. The Iron Hunters used the cold storage room (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17803runand.JournalEntryPage.03coldstorage000]{D6}</strong>) to cool off on the\n  hottest days and are aware of something moving around in a couple of the fermentation vats, though they think it’s\n  just giant rats.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kasali refuses to lead his group from the brewery until the clockwork brewers are taken care of; he and his party have\n  sworn to eliminate Alkenstar’s worst threats, not create more. The Iron Hunters are bickering in the meantime, and\n  Kasali fears this incident might spell the end of his harmonious band of monster hunters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hunters’ Aid:</strong> As long as the characters are amiable, the Iron Hunters respond in kind, though their\n  initial attitude toward the party is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fuG8dgthlDWfWjIA]{Indifferent}.

That leaves us with quite a quandary... who exactly hired\n      these rascals?”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She strokes her chin as she thinks aloud. “I suppose they could have come\n      after the formula for pyronite themselves... they do like blowing things\n      up. But this seems like too big of a play for them to make on their\n      own—too organized and too intentional, as well.

Lyzerius forged a pass into the club years ago\n    and invited the leader of the Powderkeg Punks, @Compendium[pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.ktnfNng6W5Welsn3]{Glaz\n    Nixbrix}, to the Longhorn to discuss business. The alchemist asked his guest to wear formal attire, so Glaz arrived\n    in his finest clockwork armor (which happened to be his only clockwork armor and was thus heavily soiled). Though\n    the two were able to come to an agreement on kidnapping Gattlebee, Glaz and his attendant goons were asked to leave\n    after staff saw them sprinkling black powder into other patrons’ drinks. The next day, Longhorn management suspended\n    Lyzerius’s membership.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If at least half of the characters are wearing fine or high-fashion fine clothing when they arrive at the Longhorn\n    Lounge, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to every skill check they make in the club. If all the characters are\n    wearing such clothing, the circumstance bonus increases to +2 instead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Since only members and their guests are allowed entry to the Longhorn Lounge, the characters will need to think of a\n    clever way to get in. The following are some potential methods, though allow your players to come up with their own\n    suggestions as well.\n  </p>\n  <li>\n    A character can Request a standing member to bring them in as guests with a successful\n    @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20|traits:action:request|name:Request] check.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A character can attempt a @Check[type:deception|dc:18|traits:action:impersonate|name:Impersonate] check to\n    Impersonate an existing member, assuming they know of one.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A character to forge a membership pass with a successful\n    @Check[type:crafting|dc:18|traits:action:create-forgery,secret|name:Create Forgery] or\n    @Check[type:society|dc:18|traits:action:create-forgery,secret|name:Create Forgery] check.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A character can attempt a @Check[type:stealth|dc:20|traits:action:sneak|name:Sneak] or\n    @Check[type:thievery|dc:20|traits:action:pick-a-lock|name:Pick a Lock] check to sneak in the back door.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    If any member of the party has the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4M5zIlJ8EvjQDtg9]{Dandy Dedication} archetype feat,\n    their sheer command of etiquette is enough for them to talk their way past the door guards, no check necessary.\n  </li>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/Nhalmika_Rides_Again.webp\" alt=\"nhalmika riding a steer\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/Nhalmika_Rides_Again.webp')\" />\n  <li>\n    Finally, a character can simply earn membership to the lounge, fair and square, by entering one of the weekly rodeo\n    competitions and succeeding at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:20|name:Rodeo] or @Check[type:nature|dc:20|name:Rodeo]\n    check to win.\n  </li>\n  <p>\n    Once inside, the characters need to look around for clues to figure out the identity of the Punks’ employer or at\n    least get an idea of what kind of person they’re looking for. If a character succeeds at a\n    @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:18|traits:action:gather-information,secret|name:Gather Information] check to Gather\n    Information in the Lounge, one of the patrons remembers seeing an armor-clad clockwork monkey goblin come in with\n    one of the members recently.

There was one other thing: as\n    the gangster was being escorted out, he kept shouting they “should have met at Widgetworks,” wherever that is.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To get a list of the club’s current and former members, a character might try any of the following tactics: offer a\n    member of the staff a bribe of at least 5 gp, succeed at a\n    @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:22|traits:action:request|name:Request] check to Request a copy of the list, succeed at a\n    @Check[type:deception|dc:20|traits:action:lie|name:Lie] check to convince a staff member they need a copy for\n    business reasons, succeed at a @Check[type:thievery|dc:18|name:Make a Copy] check to take a copy without being\n    noticed, or succeed at a @Check[type:intimidation|dc:16|traits:action:coerce|name:Coerce] check to Coerce a staff\n    member to hand over a copy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Treasure:</strong> If the characters use Stealth or Thievery to overcome an obstacle at this location, they\n    get the chance to steal an entire set of fine silverware worth 22 gp. If a character enters the rodeo competition\n    and critically succeeds at the Athletics or Nature check, they win the competition’s grand prize of 10 gp.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> Once the characters have learned about the Old Widgetworks Warehouse and obtained a copy\n    of the Longhorn Lounge member list, award each character 30 XP.\n  </p>"

In every case, the DC for the check is 18. Once all\n    the characters succeed, they gain access to the back room.

To abstract the brawl, ask each player to describe what\n    their character is doing to win the nonlethal brawl, then have them roll the appropriate attack roll or skill check\n    (DC 18). On a success, the character earns 1 Brawl Point. After a character has acted, a bouncer acts against that\n    character. The character must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Shove],\n    @Check[type:reflex|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Dodge Chair], or\n    @Check[type:will|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Resist Taunt] save as the bouncer pushes them, throws a chair at\n    them, or taunts them, respectively. If the character succeeds at their saving throw, they earn 1 Brawl Point.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After each party member has acted once and made one saving throw, the brawl is over. Inevitably the characters win,\n    but not before taking their fair share of punches. Characters with 2 Brawl Points take no damage, characters with 1\n    Brawl Point take @Damage[3d6[nonlethal]]{3d6 nonlethal damage}, and characters with 0 Brawl Points take @Damage[6d6[nonlethal]]{6d6 nonlethal damage}.

A creature that Strides while carrying the ladder and has a free hand can opt to move\n  at half Speed to take the ladder with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The catwalk is constructed from grids of small iron bars and is sturdy enough to hold the weight of several creatures,\n  but it wobbles slightly. All creatures on the catwalk are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy 1}.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  As the characters arrive, Nixbrix perks up and addresses the party. Read or paraphrase the following aloud to set the\n  scene.\n</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    Four raggedy hooligans peer down from the catwalk above as their leader—a goblin clad in peculiar brass machinery\n    resembling plate armor—rises to his feet atop a “throne” of clockwork junk. He rubs the grey-brown fur around his\n    green eyes before speaking, his voice surprisingly deep for a goblin. “Do my eyes deceive me, or did you actually\n    track me down? Hoo hoo! You must either want to kill me...” The hooligans above chortle and jeer, cocking the\n    hammers of their pistols and licking their vials of alchemist’s fire intimidatingly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “...or you just want to know why.” The leader’s tail swishes back and forth excitedly. “Why, that is, would a bunch\n    of powder-snortin’, fire-lightin’ hoodlums like us care about some eggheaded book-thumper? Am I right?” He idly\n    fingers a delicate key in his clockwork armor, then his face brightens suddenly, as though a thought just occurred\n    to him. “Give you a deal? One time only! You fight Bitey, my pet snake I stole fair and square. Whoever survives can\n    ask me questions! Deal?” His eyes dart between the party and the large pair of double doors to the west.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Glaz Nixbrix is far more patient and eloquent than the rest of his hotheaded crew—one of the reasons he’s the boss. He\n  gives the party some time to talk among themselves. It’s likely the characters will have questions before they decide\n  whether to take him up on his offer. The following are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and Nixbrix’s\n  responses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What if we just kill you?</strong> Nixbrix looks up at the four gunners on the catwalk, then licks a finger\n  and holds it up. “You can try, but I sense it might be raining lead soon.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Why would you want us to kill your pet snake?</strong> “I’ve fed Bitey several people who owed me and couldn’t\n  pay, but watching them get eaten has just gotten boring. Plus, Bitey eats a lot. If you kill her, one less mouth to\n  feed!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What exactly is this pet snake? </strong>“Wanna find out?” Nixbrix holds his hands up as if to clap, waiting\n  for the word.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Will you tell us who hired you/why you tried to kidnap Gattlebee?</strong>\n  “Oh yes! Anything you want to know! I have no secrets to hide... Okay, I have some secrets. But I’ll tell you all I\n  know about the egghead. Both of them.” Nixbrix winks but doesn’t elaborate on what he means by “both of them” just\n  yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Is there something we could trade/how much can we pay you?</strong>\n  “I’ll take five pounds of pyronite. I wanna blow up something big! No? Well, I guess you better choose the snake.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once they’re done grilling Nixbrix for information, the characters can decide to fight Bitey or beat the answers out\n  of Nixbrix himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If they decide to fight Nixbrix, he and his Punks are ready for a scrap and the party is in for a severe-threat\n  encounter. If able, the bombardier at the front door (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04warehouserec00]{E1}</strong>) runs to get help while\n  the gunners stay on the catwalk, firing down on the characters from above. Nixbrix uses skirmishing tactics—he moves\n  away from the characters to fire his really big gun, then closes in again to pound them with his buzz-saw knuckles.\n  When he falls to fewer than 20 Hit Points, he Leaps Away on his next turn, hoping to flee and live to fight another\n  day. If reduced to fewer than 5 Hit Points, he surrenders ignobly and begrudgingly complies with the characters’\n  demands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the outlaws agree to fight his pet snake, Nixbrix claps his hands, sits back, then pulls on a lever integrated into\n  the throne. The doors to the west open by a mechanism in the warehouse, and the emperor cobra in area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04biteysden00000]{E3}</strong> emerges. Nixbrix and the\n  gunners don’t participate in the battle but instead make side-bets and cheer for whomever they think has the best\n  chance of winning.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/mini/punks-glaz-nibrix.webp\" />\n    <h2 class=\"no-toc split\">\n      <span class=\"keepme\">E2.

Depending on how far their investigation has gotten, the\ncharacters may not even know Shoma’s name. Fortunately, Nixbrix finds the outlaws much more entertaining than “huffy\nlittle Shoma,” and so he’s glad to fill them in on everything he knows.\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “Congratulations! You survived! You must be so pleased with yourself. That was really something.” He puts a furry\n    paw up next to his mouth and stage whispers, “I also made a lot of coin on you, so thanks for winning.” Nixbrix\n    gives a thumbs up while one of the gunners pouts and sits down, counting out silver pieces. Nixbrix grins, then\n    chuckles and says, “Okay, here’s everything I know about your friend:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Sometimes this guy, @Compendium[pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.5B6jpwqblxrqJHog]{Shoma Lyzerius}, needs things\n    he can’t buy. He hires us to pick these things up, paying us with kegs of black powder or crates of alchemist’s\n    fire. Well, this time, he wanted the egghead. Bigger bounty, bigger payment. We got half up front but couldn’t\n    deliver on the goods—great job on that, by the way! Very violent. Five stars. Anyway, now little Shoma wants his\n    payment back.

You can read, right?”</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Nixbrix claps his hands, and the pouting gunner descends from the catwalk. The gunner retrieves a small crate,\n  shipping slip dangling from one of its edges and hauls it over to the characters. “You can take the stuff in the box,\n  too,” Nixbrix says. “It was mixed in with the alchemist’s fire. Buncha junk, barely even burns! What a waste.” The\n  characters receive the crate of goods described in Treasure below. The shipping label on the crate lists an address in\n  Hellside (“Hollow Manor Estates, Hillside, Apartment I-1”—this is Lyzerius’s apartment).\n</p>\n<p>\n  “Anything else you want to know?” Nixbrix is happy to engage in conversation and tell the party everything he knows\n  about Lyzerius and the plot to kidnap Gattlebee. He doesn’t know why Lyzerius wants Gattlebee, nor does he realize\n  there’s a hidden temple in Lyzerius’s apartment; the two met in Lyzerius’s living area (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04livingarea0000]{F3}</strong>).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Treasure:</strong> The crate Nixbrix gifts the characters contains six jars of moderate bottled lightning.

              "text": "<p>\n    The most likely next stop for the characters is Hellside to find Shoma\n    Lyzerius’s apartment and confront Gattlebee’s vengeful rival. This part of\n    Alkenstar is built into the west side of the Hellfallen Cliffs directly\n    across from the Screw, a giant crane capable of raising or lowering ships up\n    and down the 500-foot-tall Alken Falls waterfall. Hellside started as a\n    shanty town full of merchants looking to trade with ship captains stuck in\n    the Screw’s several hours–long ascent or descent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A complicated network of stair and walkways built into the cliffside grant\n    access to several cave-like shops, inns, apartments, and a recently built\n    carnival area. The folks there are friendly to outsiders—as long as they’re\n    buying. Otherwise, the community tends to be fairly insular and mistrustful\n    of official law enforcement, such as the shieldmarshals. The constant spray\n    from Alken Falls keeps the south side of Hellside damp and less preferable\n    for travelers and residents alike. The north side often has much more foot\n    traffic and pop-up outdoor shops that are little more than a merchant with a\n    dry rug covered in various wares.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In the past decade, the Church of Abadar has attempted to legitimize the\n    businesses here by carving huge statues of Abadar’s aspects into the\n    cliffside, with a temple, shops, and apartments beyond. They also installed\n    the Hellside Crane, a very large crane for hauling goods, though not nearly\n    as large as the Screw. Ultimately, the church’s attempts to push Hellside\n    into an upscale business district failed. A local council of merchants\n    controls the neighborhood government and generally avoids interactions with\n    the shieldmarshals, making this a great place for nefarious business\n    ventures and underhanded schemes.

The div happened to be passing by,\n    disguised in a thick hooded cloak, when they telepathically sensed the name\n    Lyzerius on one of the characters’ minds. Now, Gah’tesh is convinced these\n    mortals must be allies of the alchemist who betrayed them (see\n    <strong>Event 7</strong> for details on Gah’tesh’s motives). Gah’tesh\n    decides to capture and torture the characters to get information about\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06shomalyzeriu00]{Shoma Lyzerius}, after which the div intends to kill the traitorous ifrit.\n    Reasoning with the evil, irate div doesn’t work under any\n    circumstances—Gah’tesh is out for blood.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The character with the highest Perception modifier spots Gah’tesh following\n    them.

Following a series of mysterious coincidences which he mistook as divine signs, Lyzerius accidentally\n  tracked down a now-defunct cult of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.GX6PF9ifR47Xyjg9]{Norgorber} whom he believed were the\n  keepers of the secret that would give his miserable life some semblance of meaning. These “signs” led Lyzerius to a\n  humble apartment available for rent in the bottom tier of Hellside, only a few hundred feet above the river. So, he\n  moved in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It didn’t take Lyzerius long to discover the secret door in the back of the apartment leading to a hidden temple of\n  Norgorber. The secret rooms appeared to function as a thieves’ guild, with training rooms for pick-pocketing and\n  dozens of different types of locks for practice. The place had been abandoned, but Lyzerius discovered small texts and\n  other signs of reverence for the Gray Master, Norgorber’s aspect for thieves and extortionists, scattered around the\n  place, along with a statue of a hooded and cloaked figure in the largest room.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" />\n    <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">SCENE NOTES</span><span class=\"keepme\">FOUNDRY</span></h2>\n    <span class=\"link\">Hidden Temple</span>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Hazard Lights:</strong> The Subduing Gas Chamber in\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04lyzeriussbed00]{F5} and Broken Vats in\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04templeofnorg00]{F7} have lighting effects for when they are\n    activated.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Closing the Breach:</strong> The intense lights in\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04summoningcha00]{F6} can be switched off is the breach is\n    closed.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<p>\n  Over time, Lyzerius cleaned out the temple and used it for his secret experiments.

The praise was in jest at first, a small joke to himself for the history of his laboratory; but over time\n  his words of reverence became earnest.

I paid off that ‘Brick Buster’ buffoon and his\n      Punks to capture Gattlebee for me. They know they’ll never get pyronite\n      from him, but from me—I’ll give it to them gladly if they can hand me the\n      man with the formula!” He casts his golden eyes to the corners of his\n      ravaged workspace. “Look—I’m ruined, ok? Without my lab, I don’t have any\n      way to make money, and I owe some bad people a lot of gold. Turn me over\n      to the shieldmarshals, kill me—hell, make me your personal servant for all\n      I care. Whatever you decide, I’m as good as dead anyway. What’s the point\n      in getting pyronite now that the cat’s already out of the bag?”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lyzerius cocks his head, a surprised expression crossing his face. “Oh?\n      You didn’t know? Gattlebee’s not the only one with the formula anymore.\n      Word on the street is that some genius—someone else who was also at\n      Gattlebee’s exhibit—has already managed to reverse-engineer the recipe.\n      Didn’t everyone know that?

Somebody\n      finds this person, tortures them, and learns the secret for a world-ending\n      explosive power? Then shares it everywhere?” Knowing he’s just dropped the\n      investigatory equivalent of a master alchemist’s bomb, Lyzerius can’t help\n      but smirk.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    The following are some of the characters’ most likely questions for Lyzerius\n    and his typical responses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Someone else has the pyronite formula? Who? How? Why? </strong>“I\n    dunno the details, just the word on the street. Your guess is as good as\n    mine who we’re talking about; they were at the pyronite show, that’s for\n    sure, but who could be smart enough to figure out the recipe for pyronite\n    based on seeing it just one time? You and I both know that I’m the\n    second-best alchemist in the city, so it can’t be your run-of-the-mill\n    Blythir faculty or student. Must be someone really special to figure out the\n    formula so quickly. If I were them, I’d high-tail it out of town.” Lyzerius\n    shakes his head. “Whatever. Seems like every hack in Alkenstar’s got\n    pyronite but me.” He spits on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Why did you want to capture Gattlebee? </strong>“Have you SEEN what\n    his stuff can do? Listen, lyzerium’s good—it put me on the map—but come on.\n    My little bombs can’t hold a candle to pyronite. I guess I was just jealous,\n    to put it simply. So much for that.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>How do you know Glaz Nixbrix?</strong> “Eh. We’ve done business.\n    Other stuff. Should’ve known better than to get in bed with a hothead like\n    Glaz, of course, but there you have it. Anyway, nowadays it’s all\n    business—he wants to blow things up, I sell him the stuff he needs to make\n    that happen.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the characters have finished questioning Lyzerius, it’s up to them what\n    to do with the crooked alchemist. They might tie him up and leave him for\n    the shieldmarshals to find, simply abandon him to continue his life in\n    Hellside, or even—if you think it would make sense for your campaign—enlist\n    him to help Gattlebee’s research at the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon. Whatever\n    the case, unless they kill Lyzerius outright the characters are destined to\n    meet him again briefly in the third and final adventure of the Outlaws of\n    Alkenstar Adventure Path, “The Smoking Gun.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> For defeating Shoma Lyzerius and learning that\n    someone else has devised a copycat formula for pyronite, award each\n    character 80 XP.\n  </p>"

Attracting Ferrous\n    Quarter regulars who seek a spot not beholden to the entrenched street gangs, the clientele tends to be assertive\n    and garrulous—hard-edged survivors or workhands looking for a place to blow off steam. The largest crowd of patrons\n    usually shows up in the late afternoon and gradually dwindles until closing, at which point Foebe must invariably\n    ask the few remaining drinkers to go home or pay for a night’s sleep on the taproom’s sticky floor. Those who want\n    to get in on card games and other wagers need to arrive early to catch a spot at the rickety tables, where space is\n    always at a premium. Seats at the bar are likewise a precious commodity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Most nights, at least one fight erupts, usually with fists and chairs flying and a table flipping over. Foebe does\n    her best to keep the lid on such activities, directing her capable bouncer Ershap to force brawlers out the door\n    before the guns come out. Occasionally, the fighting gets out of hand: patrons cower under tables as Foebe shouts\n    from behind the bar, and at least one window invariably shatters as a body flies through it. If she really wants to\n    return the bar to order in a hurry, Foebe isn’t afraid to fire a warning shot from her dwarven scattergun; the many\n    holes that riddle the ceiling above the bar testify that the rounds fired aren’t blanks. At this, most of the rowdy\n    patrons settle down and return to their pints. The speed with which the taproom as a whole recovers from such\n    calamitous brawls speaks volumes to the roughness of life in the Ferrous Quarter.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Food and Drink</h2>\n  <p>\n    The Barrel &amp; Bullet offers good food at decent prices. Though not especially famous for any of its fare, the\n    saloon does offer some notable house specialties. Among these are fresh-caught “Ustradi oysters” (a particularly\n    ugly crayfish palatable only with a thick pat of butter); a full-course meal of seasonal vegetables, a generous hunk\n    of meat (typically goat), flatbread, and fig jam; and an unappealingly named but nutritionally dense stew called\n    brown bullet curry. During the winter months, Dunsmith procures spice cakes and seasonal drinks such as locally made\n    mulled ice wine, hot whiskey, or even the occasional barrel of apple cider imported from Avistan.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Prices are generally lower at the Barrel &amp; Bullet than other Smokeside taverns, thanks in part to Dunsmith’s\n    unique connection: her service to the grand duchess gives her a quiet edge in Alkenstar’s complicated procurement\n    process for the city’s imported food staples. Even with this advantage, though, the supplies available to the modest\n    saloon are unpredictable at best, so the menu changes every few days. Fortunately, Foseerter enjoys the challenge\n    and experiments freely with the food offerings. They get up early to make a variety of breads, pastries, and savory\n    pies. When they have access to sugar, the whole day’s baking is sweet, but usually, they use heartier grains to make\n    braided loaves and chewy buns that pair well with their slow-simmered stews.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc table\">table\"&gt;Services and Fare</h1>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Bulletworks use (per hour)</td>\n        <td>1 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Bulletworks use (per day)</td>\n        <td>1 gp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Firearm services</td>\n        <td></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Cleaning (per gun)</td>\n        <td>1 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Repair (per day)</td>\n        <td>1 gp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Firing range (per day)</td>\n        <td>2 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Sleeping accommodations (per night)</td>\n        <td></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Taproom floor space</td>\n        <td>5 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Bed (for 1)</td>\n        <td>3 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Private room (for 2)</td>\n        <td>1 gp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Bread of the day</td>\n        <td>1 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Brown bullet curry</td>\n        <td>2 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Full-course meal</td>\n        <td>4 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Spice cake</td>\n        <td>5 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Stew (broth only)</td>\n        <td>5 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Stew (with meat)</td>\n        <td>1 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Ustradi oysters</td>\n        <td>2 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Dunsmith’s dram</td>\n        <td>5 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Flaming whiskey</td>\n        <td>7 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Gear greaser</td>\n        <td>6 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Ghostly wainright</td>\n        <td>2 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Grenadier’s revenge</td>\n        <td>1 sp</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Smokeside sour</td>\n        <td>2 cp</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_FULL_FINAL.webp\" alt style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_FULL_FINAL.webp')\" />\n  <p>\n    More than the food, the drinks at the Barrel &amp; Bullet are what bring in the patrons. Foebe and Foseerter craft\n    the saloon’s famous mixed drinks, but credit for the bar’s signature drink, the flaming whiskey, goes to Neekle\n    Burnwater. Neekle refuses to disclose the exact ingredients, but just three drops of his tincture in a glass of\n    whiskey and alchemically treated water cause an immediate reaction of brilliant-hued flames. A favorite betting game\n    requires a round of flaming whiskeys and the ornate clockwork timer on the bar. Contestants choose a number of\n    seconds and place bets, and then Foebe starts the timer. At the chosen time, contestants quaff the flaming drink.\n    Whoever finishes the drink first—without setting their facial hair, eyebrows, or any accessories on fire—wins.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The reason that flaming whiskey doesn’t set every drinker’s face on fire has less to do with skill than with the\n    curious way the unstable magic taints the alcohol. Even when the same drink is mixed the same way, the magic’s\n    influence is unpredictable, and results in a different effect every time. In other words, Neekle’s secret mixture\n    creates flames, but whether those flames are an illusion or an inferno or a hallucination or something else entirely\n    creates flames, but whether those flames are an illusion or an inferno or a hallucination or something else entirely\n    depends on what sort of magic hides in the whiskey.

Whether it’s a gear greaser (a pint of ale with\n    a shot of rye whiskey), a ghostly wainwright (gin, whiskey, cream, and a dusting of pepper or paprika), a\n    grenadier’s revenge (brandy, gin, and berry syrup), or any number of other mixed drinks served in the taproom, a\n    drinker runs the risk of a side effect.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When a character downs a mixed drink in the Barrel &amp; Bullet, roll 1d20 and consult the following table to\n    determine what side effect, if any, occurs.

He sports the duster, cowboy hat, and brace of pistols of a typical gunslinger, and he spins\n    some great tales about his forays outside of the city, styling himself as a mercenary. His real dealings happen\n    right under the noses of the local authorities. Foebe suspects that he has some sort of hidden side job, but she has\n    yet to figure out his true connections. Meanwhile, he’s closer than any of the other regulars to discovering Foebe’s\n    own secret.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Ershap</strong> (LN female catfolk bouncer 5): Ershap has worked as the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon’s bouncer\n    since before Foebe Dunsmith became its proprietor. To the uninitiated, Ershap’s age and lithe build don’t seem\n    formidable, but new guests who underestimate her and get disruptive only make this mistake once. Ershap carries a\n    gun but rarely resorts to it—not only does she draw on years of training in martial arts, but she also isn’t afraid\n    to bite. She is Foebe’s only true confidante and knows how to facilitate meetings between the grand duchess’s envoys\n    and her drink-slinging boss without anyone being the wiser. Ershap seems omnipresent at the saloon, vigilant night\n    after night in the barroom and often sleeping during the day in an unoccupied\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.0513guestrooms00]{guest room}. The truth is that she\n    doesn’t have a home or family to call her own. Raised in an Alkenstar orphanage, she gives most of her pay to that\n    institution. She carries a single token—a locket—that’s the only clue to her parentage; even though she’s fearless\n    in confronting the saloon’s patrons, she doesn’t have the courage to search for her kin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Foebe Dunsmith</strong> (NG female dwarf spy 6): The story Foebe tells about becoming the proprietor of the\n    Barrel &amp; Bullet presents it as the de facto prize of a rifle competition that she won years ago. The contest was\n    rigged, with the saloon owner, Volessim, planning to rake it in when bets on the chosen winner paid off. When Foebe\n    beat that chosen winner against all odds, the owner didn’t have the prize cash and deeded over the saloon instead.\n    The truth is a bit more complicated, involving operatives of the Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia who persuaded Volessim\n    to capitulate because they wanted to install Foebe, an informant for the grand duchess, in his place. Foebe keeps\n    with the version that emphasizes her skill and her triumph against the odds, themes that resonate with her dwarven\n    upbringing as well as her public persona. From behind her saloon’s counter, Foebe welcomes everyone who comes in,\n    though she might quickly rescind that invitation depending on behavior. Genuinely outgoing and interested in others,\n    she contributes her own zest for life to the often rowdy atmosphere of her tavern. That atmosphere also makes it\n    easy for her to learn a great deal about the goings-on in the Ferrous Quarter and elsewhere, as her comfortably\n    inebriated guests confide in her. She thus uses her status as a humble-but-capable saloon owner to further the grand\n    duchess’s farther-reaching aims from the city’s ground floor.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Foseerter Dunsmith</strong> (LG nonbinary dwarf saloon manager 3): Because Foebe prefers the role of barkeep\n    and everyone’s-best-friend, she relies on her cousin Foseerter to handle the saloon’s administrative work. Foseerter\n    hires everyone from the kitchen staff to the bouncers and makes sure the larder is full, the kegs are tapped, and\n    the beds are made. Much quieter than their cousin, Foseerter prefers to stay out of the way and derives great\n    satisfaction from everything going smoothly, occasional bar fights or explosions notwithstanding. Foseerter has no\n    idea about Foebe’s secret life as an informant, and in turn, Foebe has no idea that Foseerter is haunted by their\n    brief stint as an adventurer. Foseerter left two wounded comrades behind in the Mana Wastes and still has nightmares\n    about that decision. They would like to venture out to recover whatever remains from that fateful day, but they’re\n    far too afraid.\n  </p>\n  <img style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/NEEKLE_BURNWATER_FINAL.webp')\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/NEEKLE_BURNWATER_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"neekle burnwater showing off his bartending skills\" class=\"float-right\" />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Neekle Burnwater </strong>(CG male goblin tinkerer 4): Intelligent and driven, Neekle can’t help but tinker\n    with anything in his hands (including his drinks).

A regular at the Barrel &amp; Bullet, Neekle often takes over a\n    table in the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.0511thebulletw00]{Bulletworks} to pull an\n    apparatus apart or pore over some sketches. He’s always willing to help mend a broken gun or a damaged clockwork in\n    exchange for a drink, though he won’t settle for merely fixing something—he’ll do his best to improve it! Neekle has\n    struggled with the dismissive attitude that many Alkenstar residents have toward goblins, and his calm disposition\n    and lack of impulsivity make the stereotypes particularly painful. He hopes that his most impressive invention, a\n    contraption that’s still under development and “top secret,” will surely change everything for both him and the\n    city’s other goblins!\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/WAYSELM_DAVRELL_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"the half orc bounty hunter wayselm davrell\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/WAYSELM_DAVRELL_FINAL.webp')\" />\n  <p>\n    <strong>Wayselm Davrell</strong> (N female tiefling half-orc bounty hunter 2): Between missions, Wayselm makes the\n    Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon her home.

While common in the\n    city, many of these products can fetch a premium in other markets.\n    Alkenstar’s only notable agricultural export is a potent ice wine pressed\n    from grapes that grow in the mountains above the city. The variety is prized\n    as a dessert treat in most of Garund, and even Avistani connoisseurs can’t\n    find its equal outside of magically augmented wines from Irrisen. The rich\n    peaks of the region also provide significant mineral wealth, a healthy\n    portion of which flows to the export market. While miners view ore and cut\n    stone as the most practical materials, the region is famed for its\n    semi-precious gems, including quartz crystals prized for their unusual size\n    and clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    While engineers in the city seldom part with clockwork constructs, Alkenstar\n    does a brisk trade in other clockwork items. Engineers here produce some of\n    Golarion’s most sophisticated prosthetics and mobility aids, and inventors\n    work closely with anatomists and adventurers to constantly improve their\n    designs. More whimsical or frivolous designs for clockwork toys and\n    housework items are also in high demand, and nobles from around the world\n    commission works to serve as statement pieces or status symbols. Considering\n    Alkenstar’s remote location, workshops are often in the market for couriers\n    to perform long-distance deliveries of these valuable items.\n  </p>"

But whereas a desert drake is sleek\n    and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the\n    prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter\n    clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial\n    wings, it’s no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked\n    child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from\n    underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert\n    their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down\n    their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays\n    from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of\n    their environs.

Even their breath weapon\n    leaves behind rich “drake soil,” coveted by farmers and gardeners for the\n    potent effects it has on plants.

He wouldn’t live by their rules anymore; he would\n    never live by anyone’s rules again except for his own.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Nixbrix made his way to the Garundi continent with the intention of living\n    for himself and no one else. Alkenstar sounded like the perfect place to do\n    just that—a land with new technology and promises of a bright future.\n    Furthermore, the region’s frequent mana storms would stifle any divination\n    spells his family might use to track him down.

They stole some fancy prototype\n    wearable clockwork armor from a gnome inventor, though only Nixbrix was\n    small enough to fit inside it. The gang took the thing for a spin, using the\n    oversized firearm strapped to its back to blast through doors and windows\n    when invading rival gangs’ territories. Nixbrix, never one for subtlety,\n    often aimed for the walls of buildings for the gang’s entrances, and he\n    quickly developed a reputation as the “Brick Blaster of Ferrous Quarter.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    As time went on, Nixbrix lost touch with his old crew, often because of\n    arrests or shoot-outs with the shieldmarshals, but he was always meeting new\n    people. He also started to understand the ins and outs of his special armor.\n    He even made a few modifications himself, like his innovative buzz-saw\n    knuckles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    One day, while staring at a massive factory fire that seemingly sprung out\n    of nowhere, Nixbrix saw a group of people running from the conflagration,\n    the shieldmarshals hot on their tail. Nixbrix decided to help some fellow\n    criminals out, bust some shieldmarshal skulls, and maybe make a few friends\n    on the way. After beating down the shieldmarshals, he hid out with the\n    people they’d been chasing and learned why they’d set the fire. “For the fun\n    of it,” it turns out, was exactly the kind of answer Nixbrix was hoping for.\n    They became fast friends. Not long after, someone floated the idea of giving\n    their little gang an official name, something to stoke fear into the hearts\n    of other Alkenstar outlaws. Nixbrix suggested the Powderkeg Punks, and\n    everyone liked this suggestion so much that they made Nixbrix their group’s\n    official boss.\n  </p>\n  <p>He liked the sound of that.</p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Glaz_Nibrix_FINAL.webp\" alt style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Glaz_Nibrix_FINAL.webp')\" />\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h2>\n  <p>\n    As the leader of the Powderkeg Punks, a gang of arsonists hired to kidnap\n    Vashon Gattlebee, Glaz Nixbrix is primarily an antagonist for the characters\n    to confront and defeat in this adventure. However, his personal motives and\n    attitude can make Nixbrix much more than a simple criminal to be beaten. The\n    gang leader has nothing personal against the characters—he just wants to\n    keep living and doing what he wants, when he wants. If the characters can\n    help him maintain this lifestyle, then they’re perfectly okay in his book.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06shomalyzeriu00]{Lyzerius} hired the Powderkeg Punks to kidnap Gattlebee, Nixbrix saw the\n    job as a chance to gain some real prestige in the Alkenstar underworld. The\n    Punks had long developed a reputation for wanton mayhem—thanks in no small\n    part to the explosive supplies they’d bought from Lyzerius for years—but\n    organized kidnapping was totally new territory, and that which Nixbrix\n    believed could launch his outfit’s criminal careers to new heights.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Lyzerius was always coming around in fancy suits and expensive shoes.\n    Nixbrix decided that he wanted in on that fancy lifestyle, at least for a\n    little while. He wanted to see what it’d be like to strut around town and be\n    admired, but those goals all fall apart when the characters show up and foil\n    his plans. After the botched kidnapping in Chapter 2 of this adventure but\n    before the characters meet him in Chapter 3, Nixbrix looks into Lyzerius a\n    bit closer and finds out that Lyzerius is no man about town—in reality, he’s\n    a pouty dropout with delusions of grandeur.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With the realization that Lyzerius isn’t going to be his ride to the top,\n    Nixbrix sets his sights on the outlaws who outgunned his Punks at the Yeast\n    of All Brewery. When they meet him at the Powderkeg Punks’ hideout, Nixbrix\n    decides to pit the characters against his monstrous serpentine pet to see if\n    they’re tough enough to take it down. If they are, then Nixbrix decides\n    they’re the right kinds of friends to have around.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Even if the characters get into a shootout with Nixbrix, the gang leader\n    still holds the party in high regard. If they establish a rapport with him,\n    Nixbrix could easily become a recurring underworld contact or ally of\n    convenience in future adventures.\n  </p>"

Failure. Mediocre.</p>\n  <p>\n    These are the words people have used to describe Shoma his entire life. As a\n    young boy, he was once seen as a prodigy who would change the face of\n    alchemy forever, but his minor genius would also prove his greatest flaw.\n    Lyzerius started attending school at Blythir College a full 2 years earlier\n    than most of his class. Lyzerius was a late bloomer, physically speaking, as\n    his small stature and boyish features compounded his childish looks. This\n    apparently huge age gap made socialization awkward for him. Though he felt\n    that he was smarter than the rest of his peers combined, they constantly\n    treated him as a mere child. Even his teachers treated Lyzerius as less\n    than, believing that someone so young must have cheated to gain entrance to\n    the prestigious college.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Determined to show everyone that he deserved his place at Blythir, Lyzerius\n    snuck into the school’s labs late at night to perform daring experiments\n    that would prove his genius. One of these experiments—a new type of\n    alchemist’s fire that could burn brighter and hotter than any before—was\n    such a catastrophic failure (or success, depending on one’s point of view)\n    that it burned the alchemy lab to the ground. He’d wanted to prove his\n    grandiose theories to a doubtful audience, but all he did was destroy a\n    fortune’s worth of equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Before Blythir’s administrators could kick him out, Lyzerius voluntarily\n    withdrew from the college. As it turned out, he did so just as his ifrit\n    blood manifested. Suddenly, he could spark fire from his fingertips, his\n    eyes turned a burnished golden hue, and he grew to his full height. His skin\n    darkened to a warm brown, the color of smoldering earth, and his pale hair\n    literally burned away as follicles of living fire replaced it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    At first, Lyzerius resented his ifrit blood, looking for a way to remove\n    what he perceived to be a curse. He wasted years of research trying to rid\n    himself of his elemental gift before he finally embraced it. At least, he\n    realized, he would never get called small or puny again; few in Alkenstar\n    would have the courage to say such things to a man bathed in perpetual\n    flame.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Confidence restored, Lyzerius dedicated himself to alchemy, studying the\n    subject on his own and perfecting his formula for a substance he called\n    “lyzerium.” He moved into an abandoned apartment, where he discovered the\n    remains of a now-defunct cult of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.GX6PF9ifR47Xyjg9]{Norgorber}. From there, he sold his\n    creations on Alkenstar’s black market and earned a strong reputation among\n    other criminal alchemists and explosives enthusiasts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Recently, Lyzerius trespassed onto Blythir College to retrieve some old\n    notes he’d left at the school. He discovered that, in the years since he\n    left, other researchers had checked out his shelved plans from the college’s\n    library. One name in particular stood out from the list of researchers: the\n    famous alchemist inventor Vashon Gattlebee, who was rumored to be on the\n    precipice of a truly explosive discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When Lyzerius confronted Gattlebee about looking at his research notes,\n    Gattlebee flatly stated that he hardly remembered the notes, but from what\n    he could recall, they were almost entirely useless. Lyzerius fumed at\n    Gattlebee’s snub and left in a huff, annoyed but satisfied with the answer.\n    He continued working on his formula until one day Gattlebee announced a new\n    form of explosive: pyronite.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Lyzerius attended Gattlebee’s public demonstration at Blythir College and\n    saw firsthand what pyronite was capable of. Utterly enraged by the genius\n    inventor’s far superior explosive, Lyzerius sent Gattlebee letters that were\n    returned, unopened. He tried to confront Gattlebee in the latter’s shack of\n    a home but received no answer. With each rebuff, Lyzerius became further\n    convinced that Gattlebee hadn’t just used his research without crediting\n    him, Gattlebee outright stole Lyzerius’s materials. There was no way that\n    anyone could create such a potent explosive without it at least being\n    partially thanks to him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Desperate to find out Gattlebee’s secret formula for pyronite, and to get\n    the credit he rightfully deserved, Lyzerius turned to some criminal contacts\n    and clients. He decided that if Gattlebee wouldn’t willingly part with the\n    formula, then Lyzerius would have to arrange for his rival’s kidnapping.\n    With an indignant and jealous fire burning in his heart, Lyzerius swore to\n    pry the secrets from Gattlebee and to have the other inventor admit to\n    stealing his life’s work.\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Shoma_Lyzerius_FINAL.webp\" alt style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Shoma_Lyzerius_FINAL.webp')\" />\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h2>\n  <p>\n    In Chapter 3 of this adventure, Foebe Dunsmith pays the characters to figure\n    out who hired the Powderkeg Punks to assail the party in the hopes of\n    kidnapping Vashon Gattlebee. The party’s investigation ultimately leads the\n    characters to the embittered Shoma Lyzerius in the ramshackle hanging\n    neighborhood of Hellside. To get to the pesky alchemist himself, the\n    characters must get through his secret hideout, an abandoned temple of\n    Norgorber he’s repurposed as a laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the party defeats his minions and catches him, Lyzerius is forced to\n    admit defeat, but by then he’s already given up hope anyway; he’s accepted\n    that he’ll never be on par with the likes of Gattlebee. Furthermore, word on\n    the street has it that another inventor—Lyzerius doesn’t know who,\n    exactly—has already reverse-engineered the pyronite formula. What would be\n    the point in getting Gattlebee to fess up to his intellectual theft now,\n    with the formula already in the hands of other Alkenstar crafters? Lyzerius\n    tells the party about this development with frustrated tears in his eyes.\n    The news might spell the end for Lyzerius’s explosive escapades, but it’s a\n    startling revelation to the party’s patron. At the end of this adventure,\n    Dunsmith tells the characters that if the formula for pyronite has indeed\n    been leaked, then the outlaws’ work for the grand duchess has only just\n    begun.\n  </p>"
