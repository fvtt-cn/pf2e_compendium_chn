		"Artillerist": {
			"name": "Artillerist",
			"description": "<h1>Artillerist</h1>\n<p>The artillerist's maxim holds that while fights might be won with swords, battles are won with cannons. Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p>\n<p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4>\n<p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p>\n<p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been “won” when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p>\n<p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p>\n<p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.txWKzKuJus7UBebX]{Artillerist Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7WBIXGqZbAKbqEU6]{Named Artillery} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.IeRX0tGbeOF0ev08]{Shorthanded} Feat 4</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pph43ZrfvEnQjJXE]{Cannon Corner Shot} Feat 6</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.moXYfz806x6uXIW9]{Field Artillery} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ivSf8wSIUkK8gwej]{Live Ammunition} Feat 8</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kVSZQvsz1cYjOwxL]{Master Siege Engineer} Feat 16</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.</p>"

			"description": "<h1>Beast Gunner</h1>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Choosing Your Beast Gun</h4>\n<p>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.L1gD3VMD5X9JNJzE]{Beast Gunner Dedication} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt (see above); trained in Arcana and Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've bonded to your beast gun and unlocked the first hints of its hidden potential.

You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force on the battlefield. You might wield a banner in the name of a greater organization, a liege, or an ideal you uphold, or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers.</p>\n<p><strong>CAVALIER PLEDGES</strong></p>\n<p>Many cavaliers pledge themselves in service to a specific organization or individual, such as a noble family or sovereign ruler, a knightly order or another organization, or a particular ideal. A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual.

These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTINCT OF THE WYRM</strong></p>\n<p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.oo34CloLefFRi72w]{Dragon Disciple Dedication} Feat 2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

Even so, you probably have a few themes that you prefer for each of your firework technician feats. For instance, your Coughing Dragon Display might appear in the sinuous serpentine shape of a literal imperial dragon, coughing out glittering trails. It might also resemble a simple series of geometric shapes, an enigmatic spiraling aeon trailing off in a shape with radial symmetry, a pattern shaped like a tree blossoming with flowers in the sky, or anything else you can imagine. To help your fellow players visualize what your character is doing, you might come up with some go-to descriptions or draw art depicting some of your favorite displays.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MVbNnjqQOK9d8Ki3]{Firework Technician Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned the secrets of making fire and sound bloom using black powder, metals, and paper.

Whenever there's a threat or opening, you're the first to point it out, and you're ready to help your allies directly when necessary.</p>\n<p>.As a group's overwatch, you might let the position go to your head. In such cases, you might think of yourself as the mastermind behind the chessboard and feel detached from your allies, thinking of them as little more than pawns on the field.</p>\n<p>But more likely your role allows you to feel a deeper connection to your allies, and your coordination and heroics stand out most when you subsume your individual ego to serve the group's needs. In that case, you might think of yourself as a part of a functional whole—if your party was a single living body, you serve as the eyes, but that doesn't mean you're the brain, the heart, or other vital organs. Everyone has a crucial role to play.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Overwatch Training</h4>\n<p>Not just anyone can train to become their party's overwatch. A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.t03Tc5I4B8RHsyqs]{Overwatch Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. You gain resistance equal to your level + 2 to damage of the selected type. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> You gain weakness 1 to all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Planar Pain</strong> (evocation) Weapon only. When you manifest the essence form, choose one damage type: acid, chaotic, cold, electricity, evil, fire, good, lawful, negative, positive, or sonic. Attacks with the weapon deal this type of damage instead of their physical damage with a +2 status bonus to the damage. <em>Corruption Flaw</em> When you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed attack, you take 2 damage of the last type you chose for planar pain, even if the damage type normally wouldn't harm you, such as good damage if you aren't evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Pull of Stasis</strong> (transmutation) Weapon only.

Each armament can manifest its essence form only once per day.</p>\n<p>When you gain soulforged corruption, choose one armament's corruption flaw to affect you for stage 1. At stage 2, you take the flaws of all your soulforged armaments. While you have the curse, each armament gets a separate flat check to manifest its essence form, and failing prevents you from manifesting only that armament's essence form.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat a second time at 12th level or higher, choosing the final item type.</p>"

			"description": "<h1>Spell Trickster</h1>\n<hr />\n<p>Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>The Fruits of Research</h4>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects. Whenever you gain a feat from this archetype, you either learn to modify the effects of a single spell, or you change one of the modifications from a previous feat. Each time you Cast the Spell corresponding to the feat you chose, you decide whether to cast its normal or modified version. You can only apply one modification to a spell at a time, even if you know more than one modification for that spell. Besides modifications mentioned in the feat, the spell functions as normal.</p>\n<p>Choose up to two 4th-level spell trickster archetype feats for which you meet the spell-casting prerequisite. You gain those feats, ignoring their level prerequisite.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the spell trickster archetype. The two feats you gain from taking the dedication don't count toward this total.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jZbhRBR2yawntSmd]{Agile Hand} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.pwzdSlJgYqN7bs2w]{Mage Hand}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be a set of thieves' tools. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Xjn4iYzJ6rLIpLV3]{Barrier Shield} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.TVKNbcgTee19PXZR]{Shield}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast shield, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking. You can't use the Shield Block reaction when the spell is modified in this way, but you (and only you) can spend an action to Take Cover to gain standard cover from it.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SASOvOG2Nqs2ekdA]{Forceful Push} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.pwzdSlJgYqN7bs2w]{Mage Hand}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace its standard effects with the following: You push your foe telekinetically. Make a spell attack roll against the target's Fortitude DC. On a success, you push the target 5 feet away from you. On a critical success, you push the target 10 feet away from you.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.iAziUKdxgy4k4ypY]{Shining Arms} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.WBmvzNDfpwka3qT4]{Light}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast light, you can modify its target to be 1 melee weapon, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally, and modify its duration to be 1 minute. If you do, add the following to its effects: When a creature wielding the weapon critically hits a foe, you can Dismiss the Spell as a reaction, causing the foe to be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round. After you use this reaction, you can't use this modification again for 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CX4ISbBwndRWhP55]{Summon Ensemble} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.yvs1zN5Pai5U4CJX]{Summon Instrument}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast summon instrument, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 1 minute. When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you Sustain the Spell, choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance. The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} for 1 round. The target is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.dtt6xTOSF8PuoStg]{Tracing Sigil} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.AUctDF2fqPZN2w4W]{Sigil}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sigil, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to Track the target, substituting an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the Survival check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.BQkqUrlUVNFp8BEq]{Wild Lights} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.kl2q6JvBZwed4B6v]{Dancing Lights}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast dancing lights, you can modify its duration to be 1 minute and modify its standard effects to create a single floating light in the shape of a Tiny creature, instead of up to four floating lights. The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere. If the light ever moves beyond 120 feet of you, it winks out immediately.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.bi9w4Z9MQY8VWLZF]{Animate Net} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rVANhQgB8Uqi9PTl]{Animate Rope}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast animate rope, you can modify its target to be 1 net. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You cause a net to animate and throw itself at a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet of the net. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} until it Escapes. The Escape DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the Escape DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can Interact to remove the net.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.V3lFDAQr3PfnAxMC]{Confounding Image} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.j8vIoIEWElvpwkcI]{Mirror Image}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mirror image, you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC - 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the image to an unoccupied square within range.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.UEbBOljjXvKsGKFu]{Disk Rider} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.LvezN4a3kYf1OHMg]{Floating Disk}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast floating disk, you can modify its duration to be sustained, up to 10 minutes. If you do, add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The disk can hold up to 10 Bulk. The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being encumbered. If you ride atop the disk, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 30 feet or your Speed, whichever is slower, each time you Sustain the Spell. While you ride atop it, the disk can move over liquids as long as it ends its movement on solid ground. If it ends its movement on a surface that can't support it, the spell ends.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.6vpgAMj87J6cWN0j]{Drenching Mist} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.9XHmC2JgTUIQ1CCm]{Obscuring Mist}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast obscuring mist, you can modify it to add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Your mist is particularly laden with moisture. Non-magical fires within the area are automatically extinguished.

The area within the fog is difficult terrain for creatures that can't see through fog or mist. You can Dismiss the cloud.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.J06CgMzMDGOahXjf]{Uneasy Rest} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.o4lRVTwSxnOOn5vl]{Sleep}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast sleep, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Subjects of your spell experience troubled dreams.

The target must attempt a Reflex save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is splattered with grease and gains weakness 2 to fire until the end of your next turn.

While the spell lasts, you can spend a single action, which has the concentrate, detection, and divination traits, to attempt to locate the target, learning the direction to the target as long as you are within 1 mile of it. If the target is a creature or a creature is in possession of the target object, the creature can attempt a Will saving throw against your spell DC. If it succeeds, your attempt to locate the target fails and you can't attempt this again for 1 day. You can only have a single target marked with a sigil modified in this way.

Add the following to the spell's standard effects: If the creature attending the object is willing to have you take the item, mage hand carries the item to you. If the creature is unwilling, you must attempt to Steal the target object with a Thievery check.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code—a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions. However, spellshots remain particularly rare in the Inner Sea region due to the unique history of guns there and their connection to the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, which exists in a magic-dead region of the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.BwDIwjHasZwcd61Z]{Spellshot Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.OmgtSDV1FubDUqWR]{Way of the Spellshot}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition.

You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design.</p>\n<p>There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<p>With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.</p>\n<p>As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities.

A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR.

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage} and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm]{Modular Dynamo} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo attack gains the modular trait, as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver ([[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage}; shove), percussive striker ([[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage}; agile, finesse), rotating sickle ([[/r {1d6}[slashing]]]{1d6 slashing damage}; trip), or entangling barbs ([[/r {1d6}[piercing]]]{1d6 piercing damage}; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton ([[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage}; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.</p>\n<p>When you use an Interact action to switch configurations using the modular trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, you choose another configuration and add it to the list of options you can choose when you use an Interact action with the modular trait.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.0SbHdwYumvmzwWw3]{Piston Punch} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out with a powerful punch, extending your dynamo to a greater length in order to attack two creatures in a row. Make a single bludgeoning or piercing dynamo Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes. The first foe must be within your melee reach and the second foe must be adjacent to the first foe in a straight line away from you. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Piston Punch counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.A0keRhzNlcB1u4gD]{Stasian Smash} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Ustalav.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've modified your dynamo with Stasian coils, allowing you to make a powerful attack that crackles with electricity. Make a dynamo Strike. On a success, the Strike deals an additional [[/r {1d12}[electricity]]]{1d12 electricity damage} to the target, as well as [[/r {1d4}[electricity]]]{1d4 electricity damage} to up to two other foes within 10 feet as sparks leap across the gaps. If you critically fail your dynamo Strike, you take [[/r {1d12}[electricity]]]{1d12 electricity damage}. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. At 18th level, the additional electricity damage to the target increases to 2d12, and the additional electricity damage to the other foes increases to [[/r 2d4]]{2d4}. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.K0x90HNHi5hONdDl]{Beast Dynamo Howl} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are from Arcadia.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying creatures to enhance your prosthesis's capabilities. The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.xzesXSIXTqsVxm1e]{Golem Dynamo} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are an automaton or are otherwise from the ancient Jistka Imperium.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses, allowing you to incorporate golem components into your dynamo and gain a portion of their magic.

You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed.

Your snares include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears, and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or trapsmith archetypes.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7Hx0i4VchvwrIOV5]{Gear Gnash} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}, expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable. Creatures attempting to Disable your snares that use gears must succeed at an additional Thievery check in order to disable the snare. On a failed check, while the snare doesn't fully trigger, the grinding mechanisms deal bludgeoning damage to the creature equal to half your level. The snare still triggers on a critical failure, as normal.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.UkMG3wMvrw8X0I98]{Propeller Attachment} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}, master in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've mastered attaching clockwork propellers to your daily quick-deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to place your snares in the air or underwater, where they remain in place for up to 10 minutes, after which the propeller runs out of power and they fall or sink. Unless you use additional precautions to hide it, a propeller snare's location is usually obvious.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.WmSggxmf4iAe2aRD]{Recycled Cogwheels} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're able to scavenge the cogwheels from your daily quick-deploy snares that use gears. This allows you to deconstruct a snare that didn't trigger in order to set the snare up somewhere else. Doing so takes the same number of actions as setting the snare did. When you do, you recover the snare and can deploy it in another location.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.UJcQgQpZRqXBw0Nb]{Repurposed Parts} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that you know how to Craft, even if you didn't prepare that snare during your daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.k9B7gDit3pXbq2XF]{Finessed Features} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned how to build snares that trigger based on visual stimuli. When you construct a snare using gears, you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise satisfy the snare's trigger as normal.</p>"

Perhaps you shot at a tree branch that then fell on the targets, or one target's scream caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction.

Reduce the number of crew required to operate your signature vehicle by 25%. For example, you would reduce a sailing ship from needing 1 pilot and 8 crew to 1 pilot and 6 crew.

		"Vigilante": {
			"name": "Vigilante",
			"description": "<h1>Vigilante</h1>\n<p>As a vigilante, you have two faces: a public persona, and a secret identity that lets you hide your extralegal actions from polite society. Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose- fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos-your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 4th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qFt6zyWVX1njJf1l]{Quick Draw}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uqIiSDbv80TbRwTQ]{Vigilante Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Deception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity-a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p>\n<p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p>\n<p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Vigilante archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.K3Au5071pfvNwGob]{Hidden Magic} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.rAbfuZ1mc3lUYH41]{Minion Guise} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> animal companion or familiar, expert in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.vKzAIJuyr9SU2JzU]{Safe House} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.rNPeOwFZE5Ma18JJ]{Social Purview} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qg8TlLJRgvjzW9YK]{Startling Appearance} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is flat-footed against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains flat-footed for the rest of your turn and is frightened 1 (frightened 2 on a critical hit).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.v1PtAazmEFhTp6fZ]{Quick Change} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can shift between your identities with ease. Instead of spending 1 minute to change your identity, you can now do so as a 3-action activity. If you are legendary in Deception, you can perform this change as a 1-action activity.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.oXoQ9wwOmDe0hwbU]{Subjective Truth} Feat 7</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your disparate identities allow you to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jZalt2bFGjK8XXcP]{Many Guises} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual-rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC. You can't use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ano4tRq88V39eyPq]{Frightening Appearance} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders. When you make a Startling Appearance, you can also attempt to Demoralize each opponent within 10 feet to whom you were unnoticed before your Strike.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.EwCDbWg8yPxDWF4a]{Stunning Appearance} Feat 16</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your sudden appearance leaves your foe unable to respond. When you use Startling Appearance, if your foe's level is equal to or lower than yours, they are also stunned 1 on a hit, or stunned 2 on a critical hit.</p>"
