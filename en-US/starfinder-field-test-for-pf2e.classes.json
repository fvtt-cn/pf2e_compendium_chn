			"description": "<p>You are a master of area weapons, heavy armor, and taking punishment. You stand in the thick of the battle and unleash devastating salvos against your foes, while taking withering fire in return. By laying down a barrage of suppressing fire with powerful weapons, you set your allies up to fulfill their respective roles, while encouraging enemies to focus on you.</p>\n<h2>During combat encounters...</h2>\n<p>You set yourself up on the battlefield to rain down fire with heavy weapons. You then take abuse from foes as they advance through your attacks, having the ability to swap to heavy melee attacks once your foes close the distance.</p>\n<h2>During social encounters...</h2>\n<p>You often stand back and let others do the talking, while providing support with the threat of your weaponry and sheer bulk. Sometimes you might surprise others with an insightful take.</p>\n<h2>While exploring...</h2>\n<p>You're at the front of the group, weathering any foes or hazards that appear along the way. You position yourself so you can take advantage of your weaponry, but you also act as a shield for your allies.</p>\n<h2>In downtime...</h2>\n<p>You work long and exhausting jobs. You might take time to retrain certain things you've learned, or tinker with your heavy weapons and procure new ammunition and upgrades. You might...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employ your heavy weapons to take the brunt of the enemy's attention in combat, relishing the attention while taking heavy fire.</li>\n<li>Rush forward into danger, knowing that your sheer bulk and endurance will see you through.</li>\n<li>Make dangerous gambits when employing your area of effect weapons, either putting yourself or your allies in danger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rely on you to take the lead and absorb incoming fire.</li>\n<li>Assume there's not much more to you than wielding big weapons and taking a beating.</li>\n<li>Appreciate what your presence alone brings to the negotiating table.</li>\n</ul>"
