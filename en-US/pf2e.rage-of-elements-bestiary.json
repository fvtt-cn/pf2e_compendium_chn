Shuyookhs view their desires as greater than those around them, leading them to provide aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, fulfilling the terms of bargains expediently and to the letter.</p>\n<p>Jabali shuyookhs are industrious and have many interests, including athletic competitions, engineering, jewelry-making, masonry, metalworking, and sculpting. They enjoy games of chance and bargaining, whether in a gambling hall, arena, or marketplace. Some mix their interests by managing organizations or guilds involving such concerns. Many shuyookhs reap the wealth of the Plane of Earth for sale elsewhere and speculate on the value of such commodities.</p>\n<h2>Industry Titans</h2>\n<p>The mercantile empires of jabali shuyookhs extend across the Plane of Earth and onto other planes. Jabalis especially like to trade in regions of the Universe and across the Plane of Fire. Many customers value gemstones, metals, and other precious materials mined on the Plane of Earth.

Behind their maw burns a powerful internal oven, where the elemental creatures roast their prey. Brochmaws are driven solely by their voracious appetites, only leaving their lairs to acquire new meals. Early attempts to force brochmaws into service resulted in their would-be captors being reduced to nothing more than ash on a plate, accompanied by a written review of how they tasted. Now, brochmaws are employed all across the Planes, lured by the sweet promise of new, fresh meat.</p>\n<p>Though brochmaws have no use for money, they do trade gifts for services. The only thing they have to offer is cooked meat from their own mouths, which they deem extremely valuable. Surprisingly, all who have tried brochmaw meat claim it to be a savory roasted delight. Given that brochmaws offer nothing but cooked meat and desire nothing but raw meat, trading with them is a simple if slightly dangerous affair, often coming down to the quantity and rarity of the meat offered.</p>\n<p>Brochmaws hate to see meat go to waste. If one discovers a carcass of any sort, they call others of their kind to join them in a festive cookout, with dancing and feasting inevitably accompanied by compliments or complaints about the quality of the food.</p>\n<h2>Planar Delicacies</h2>\n<p>Though brochmaws love to devour new things, they still have favorite meals they like to keep on hand. Brochmaws love amphibian meat, though the origin of this appeal is a mystery. They will eagerly consume geniekin of all kinds because the magical blood produces a psychedelic effect. Brochmaws think celestials are as dangerous as they are delicious, requiring a precise cooking process to avoid killing the consumer. Most brochmaws are far too impatient to prepare celestial meat properly, often to disastrous results.</p>",

They can even be found on the Plane of Earth thanks to interplanar trade. In Medina Mudii'a, brass bastions walk the streets, tend shops, and stand guard. Bespoke brass bastions are passed down as family heirlooms or gifted to business partners and allies. Scions of the wealthiest ifrit lineages never travel without a train of brass bastions clad in family livery. Destroying a rival ifrit's brass bastion is a quick way to erode their political status, though anyone caught performing such sabotage faces swift retribution.</p>\n<p>Most brass bastions prominently display the sigil of their owner or maker, though magical methods can also determine who crafted a specific construct. Brass bastions forged by favored artisans are a status symbol in many ifrit communities. Ifrits consider a brass bastion crafted by a non-ifrit to be inherently inferior, barely worth the cost of its materials. Brass bastions obey magical programming imprinted at the time of their creation or follow commands from their owners. Most can't speak, but a few have magical voices and can parrot simple phrases, recite poetry, or tell bedtime stories at the crafter's fancy.</p>\n<h2>Brass Scraps</h2>\n<p>On the Plane of Fire, destroyed brass bastions are sold as scrap to enterprising ifrits, who reforge the remains into new brass bastions. Many ifrits pay more for the remains of a brass bastion crafted by their rivals yet react violently when offered brass bastion remains they originally created. Thus, identifying a brass bastion's original crafter is a valued skill. Few non-ifrits dare trade in brass bastion scraps, save in extralegal markets.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Some ardandes say life in Nodollin is filled with infantilization and belittlement from the kizidhars, the wood genies who rule the land and much of the plane. The kizidhars largely view ardandes as genies like them, but a lesser form of genie that ranks below kizidhar commoners in the same way they are lesser to the shuyookhs. Though a few ardandes rebel against this social order, the weight of culture tells them hierarchies are natural to the element of wood, and they should accept their place even if they chafe.</p>\n<p>Many planar ardandes moved to Shodokar when the new city was founded, hoping the influx of portals leading out of the Plane of Wood would let them visit the rest of the multiverse and learn about their lost mortal heritage. They delight in meeting visitors and showing off the beauty and wonders of their home plane. Some have even moved to the Universe, and they make invaluable mentors for the new ardandes only just discovering their elemental potential across Golarion.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>The truth of life in the Universe is that weather controls the world. The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

The woods can be a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weather\u2014weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Occasionally, they even establish colonies on planes other than their own, should their newfound territory prove filled with crystals.</p>\n<p>A crysmal's scorpion-like body glitters with crystal. As light refracts between the facets, they concentrate and absorb it, energizing the crysmal and, some say, fueling the creature's magic.</p>\n<p>Crysmals form small communities in locations where crystals are plentiful, working alongside one another to track down anything from a common quartz to precious rubies and sapphires. Scouting parties use their innate magic to communicate with each other via light and wordless sound, as well as to seek out more crystals. However, when precious stone resources grow scarce, crysmals become independent and territorial about their supply, taking crystals from wherever they can, even seizing them from other creatures.</p>\n<p>A crysmal's drive to gather crystals is akin to the drive to reproduce. As a crysmal gathers stones, it stores them within its body. Once the crysmal has enough stored material, the parent fuses its stores into a tiny replica of itself and extrudes the infant crysmal, sometimes referred to as a shardling, into the world. The process leaves the parent weakened for a short time, until it can gather enough crystal to repair its body and begin the process anew. Infant crysmals consume crystals in a similar way. They process the raw material over a few months to grow to adult size. Thereafter, a crysmal \"eats\" stone only to heal injuries.</p>\n<h2>Internal Gems</h2>\n<p>When a crysmal dies, its body breaks into fragments of crystal. Some of these pieces are valuable, but potentially more lucrative are the gems the crysmal has stored inside its body to produce offspring. It takes semiprecious and precious stones worth 500 gp to produce an infant crysmal, though most slain crysmals have only a fraction of this amount stored. Once the stones become a new crysmal, they transform into the crystal of the infant's body, no longer the treasured material they once were.</p>",

One of the more popular theories about the tantriog's current form is that in the past, they used to be able to shift shape as easily as water molds to its container. In their endless boredom, they were trying out a variety of shapes when a sudden curse (possibly cast by faydhaans) caused them to lose their ability while transforming from a turtle to a crab, leaving them stuck between the two. It's said that any who can teach a tantriog how to relearn their morphing ability could earn the elemental's undying friendship. Whatever the case, the surest way to anger a tantriog is to ask them about their appearance.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the surest way to befriend a tantriog is with compliments about their appearance or their skills. Don't be too fawning, though. Tantriogs don't like being tricked or made to look a fool.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>IMPRESSING A TANTRIOG</p>\n<p>A tantriog loves seeing a new sight or impressive exhibition of skill. Anyone who wants to stay in a tantriog's good graces needs to keep the new experiences flowing. For this reason, many tantriogs have formed unlikely friendships with gnomes, whose need to seek out new experiences provides common ground.</p>",

These flat, round fish are covered in a moss-like skin that makes them exceptionally difficult to spot as they hug the sides of flotsam, feeding off the waste that drifts into their wide, open mouths.</p>\n<p>While olobigondes are primarily detritivores, they've been known to lie in wait within a forest of kelp or against a mossy stone to ambush smaller creatures, such as water scamps or lone passing merfolk. The fish launch themselves from their hiding spot to take large bites out of their surprised prey, then grab the victim as it tries to flee. Despite their size and ungainly shape, olobigondes can move quickly in water, though their bursts of speed are usually short-lived. In addition to maintaining a firm hold on prey, olobigondes' mouths are filled with a unique toxin that weakens and decomposes living flesh. The hungry fish easily gulp down the resulting slurry.</p>\n<p>Ancient olobigondes grow truly immense, and their outward appearance evolves. There seems to be no limit to their size. Their skin even separates into plates with deep channels where water can accumulate, giving them the appearance of an entire patch of detritus rather than one piece.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Alchemists who travel the planes have discovered how readily an olobigonde's toxin can decompose flesh, and some have discovered ways to incorporate it into their creations.

Lomori sprouts meticulously collect the trimmings, seeds, and debris from the flora in their care.

They're shy and skittish, often losing themselves in their labors, but they're always friendly to those who treat their gardens with respect.</p>\n<p>Lomoris are aeon spirits dispatched to the elemental planes long ago to pursue the act of creation. While most of the aeons dispatched to the other elemental planes performed their duties and rejoined their aeon brethren, those on the Plane of Wood lingered, becoming trapped as the plane receded. Over the ages, they adapted and evolved into lomoris. Today, lomoris have more in common with the other denizens of the Plane of Wood than they do with their aeon ancestors.</p>\n<p>Lomori sprouts, much like conrasus, have a central black sphere, known as a lomori's core, that functions as their primary body and consciousness. Where conrasus forge a sturdy exoskeleton, lomoris cultivate a tall mound of prairie grass surrounding their core, which easily grows to be 2\u20133 times the core's height. The lomori shapes the mound as it grows, creating protective layers to guard their core and forming other useful appendages. Most lomoris have six intricately detailed, crab-like legs of wood that emerge from the lower half of their core, allowing them to rapidly scuttle across the ground or climb trees.</p>",
