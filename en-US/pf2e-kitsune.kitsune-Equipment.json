As a kitsune, you gain the kitsune trait, low-light vision, and the Change Shape action, which you can use to return to their true form. If you were already a kitsune, you are reverted back to your true form if you were in an alternate form and you gain a random 1st level kitsune ancestry feat you didn't already have.
