You also gain the incorporeal trait, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the Pass Through feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally-you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks-typically Athletics checks-against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>",

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.6KciIDJV6ZdJcAVa]{Sterling Dynamo} archetype.</p>",

You gain the ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.hs7h8f4Z1ZNdUt3s]{Summon Fey}</em> as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day. At 18th level the spell heightens to 8th level, and at 20th level it heightens to 9th level.</p>\n<p>The first time you die after gaining this feat, the bond you made with the fey invokes the power of the First World to return you to life. Immediately after dying, you revive, becoming conscious (and wounded as normal) at 27 Hit Points, and you gain the fey trait. Your eyes become a rainbow of colors, and you take on a visual aspect of the fey with whom you are bound, such as by growing wings, horns, or a plantlike body. The change has no mechanical effect; for instance, the wings wouldn't allow you to fly, nor would horns grant a horn unarmed attack.</p>\n<p>The second time you die, you reawaken in the First World with the full appearance of the fey that was bound to you. You become an NPC, unconcerned with your old mortal life. You can be returned to your previous life in the Material Plane by having allies spend 3 days building a shrine to the First World, giving three offerings that hold deep sentimental value for you or another, and holding a raucous, three-day long feast.</p>\n<p>Any time that you die after that, you reawaken again in the First World with no memories of your previous life, and you can only be brought back by powerful magic such as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em> spell.</p>",

Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact action starting at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a mind smith's keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can't be a magic item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon, and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other weapons or runestones for the usual cost.
