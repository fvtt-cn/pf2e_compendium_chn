These small arms work in tandem with compact batteries to unleash pinpoint shots of directed energy at their intended targets. Lower-end models tend to gobble up battery charges, while higher- end models often trade overall capacity for increased damage.</p>"

Rotolasers can unleash a blistering hail of fire or be calibrated to fire single shots in short succession without worrying about depleting ammunition. They straddle the line between being a full area suppression weapon and a tactical rifle, though paying for that price in weight.</p>"

A fired scattergun unleashes a spray of tiny projectile shells that wither nearby targets with the force of their impact.</p>"

To ensure optimal usage in the most chaotic of environments, the stellar cannon eschews many technological components, instead relying on its wielder to provide most of the aiming.</p>"
