			"description": "<p>This immaculate golden set of merchant's scales is considered a divine instrument among Abadar's most faithful. Unlike most scales, this one has only a single dish for placing small objects, and calculates value rather than weight. On the other side of the fulcrum, a steel arrow indicator points to various numbers engraved on the side of the scale.</p>\n<p>By placing an object of light Bulk onto the dish, you can determine its value in gold pieces in the market in which the scale was made (most of these scales are made in Katapesh or Absalom), based on its material composition and artisanship.</p>\n<p>For example, after placing a gemstone on the dish, the scale will indicate the fairest (average, in most cases) price you can expect to fetch in the market to which the scale is calibrated, but the scale wouldn't detect the gemstone's historical significance or any magical properties. <em>Abadar's flawless scale</em> can be calibrated to a different market by performing a 1-hour ritual in the proximity of that market.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The aquarium lamp is a combination light source and exotic animal aquarium, intended to provide rich nobles amusement and illumination. It takes the shape of a glass cube 50 feet wide and seven feet high filled with sea water, flanked by two much smaller water tanks. A sparse brass frame around the device keeps the tanks themselves from touching the ground and serves as a mounting point for a pair of electrical coils on the top, which are enclosed within separate glass tubes. Six electric eels swim within the central tank, while a number of animals belonging to species considered to be the eels' natural prey swim in the smaller feeding tanks. With the simple pull of a lever attached to either smaller tank, one of the prey animals is released into the eel tank. Within seconds, the eels converge on the hapless animal, using their electrical charges to stun their victims. When this happens, the salty seawater conducts the electrical energy into transfer coils hidden within the brass frame, which send the energy to the top-mounted electrical coils. The end result produces enough light to fully illuminate a room as though it were midday.</p>\n<p>This device is an expression of a recent trend among certain Avistani nobles to blend form and function in their manors' interior decorations. In such circles, ostentatious decorations that serve no functional purpose are derided as \"tacky\" and \"unrefined.\" If a noble in such company wishes not to be ridiculed, they must be sure that each decoration adds something to the room beyond the aesthetic. The aquarium lamp is the latest tool in this social arms race, and it's already proven popular with its target market.</p>\n<p>When active, the aquarium lamp produces bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet). Each activation provides enough energy for 10 minutes of use, and the two feeding tanks combined carry enough prey animals for 50 activations before needing to be refilled, though electric eels usually need feeding only once per day, and won't go after the prey if they're all full. While electric eels are not aggressive to their aquarium keepers and will gradually learn to associate them with food, they can engage in violent social behavior, especially when they are young. This behavior leads to small fights involving tail slapping, biting, and discharged electricity, the last of which causes the lamp to illuminate without hitting the lever to release prey. The electric eels live around 15 years if kept well-fed.</p>"

However, she still harbored in her heart a fierce pride in what dwarves had accomplished. She had long fought against the cult of Droskar, seeing it as emblematic of all the worst parts of dwarven culture.</p>\n<p>By the time she infiltrated Droskar's Crucible in 4065 AR, the cult was already in decline. She knew portions of Droskar's Crucible were built by the worshippers of Torag who preceded the cult and that something of great power had been locked away in the Lower Vault, but not what that object was. If she could gain control over the cult, she could simultaneously use them to open the Lower Vault and convince them to set aside their worship of Droskar-if not for her own patron, Cayden Cailean, then any other faith with a more positive leaning.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, her attempt to seize control of the cult using their own traditions against them backfired when she succumbed to the Soul Smith. Unlike the others who were slain by the Soul Smith, Azarim's soul managed to somewhat escape being bound into the Soul Smith's soul chain by instead seeking shelter in her own magic rapier. Frustrated at the fact her soul slipped away but ignorant of where that soul fled to, the Soul Smith returned to his tasks and soon forgot about Azarim-she was, to the undead dwarf, just another in a long line of failures.</p>\n<p>Today, <em>Azarim </em>is an intelligent <em>+1 striking shifting @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.tH5GirEy7YB3ZgCk]{Rapier}</em>. The rapier has been waiting patiently for centuries for a new, like-minded ally to take her up in arms against her foes.</p>\n<p>While she prefers to exist in the form of a rapier, she can use one of her actions to activate her shifting rune to take the shape of another weapon as needed.</p>\n<p>While <em>Azarim </em>prefers to be wielded by chaotic good characters, particularly those who worship Cayden Cailean, she's open-minded and eager to work with any wielder who seeks to oppose corrupting or toxic traditions in society, particularly those who work against the influence of the cult of Droskar. To wielders she doesn't approve of, she works to convince them to either change their ways or to hand her over to someone who she can work with, resorting to her ability to induce weakness in her carrier as needed when simply having them discard her is the only option left.</p>\n<p><em>Azarim </em>deals an additional [[/r 1d6[chaotic]]] damage to worshippers of Droskar, to creatures allied with Droskar's faith, and to those who are under the influence of Droskar's faith-which includes the Kobold King Merlokrep for as long as he continues to wear his crown as well as most of the intelligent inhabitants of the deeper levels of Droskar's Crucible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature picks up <em>Azarim</em> or begins its turn carrying <em>Azarim</em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The creature who carries Azarim becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7]{Enfeebled 2}.

As long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature remains alive and can continue to think, even though its body is dead. Detachable modules that fit into the base of the cylinder allow the brain to see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker. So long as these are attached, the brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, though nothing within the cylinder compels it to do so if it is unwilling. It also retains its living alignment, and can use Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills. A standard brain cylinder has one skill at +15, one at +13, and two at +11, as chosen by the GM.</p>\n<p>The brain retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental ones. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes, as a brain preserved in this manner can live for centuries. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain dies and its soul finally moves on to the Boneyard. Restoring a brain in a brain cylinder to its former body can be done by any effect that restores life (and, in most cases, any capable of creating a new body, since the original is typically missing or long gone).</p>\n<p>Note that the level 6 brain cylinder presented represents a level 6 creature's brain. A less powerful or more powerful brain can be placed in a brain cylinder, which can affect the brain cylinder's Perception, mental ability scores, Will save, and skill modifiers (and can drastically alter the value of the brain cylinder), but the physical properties of the brain cylinder remain unchanged. Higher-level brain cylinders can be crafted, with resistances and weaknesses increasing as appropriate to their level. However, they always have low AC and HP and terrible Fortitude and Reflex saves for a creature of the brain cylinder's level.</p>\n<p>You can open a brain cylinder by taking three consecutive actions with the manipulate trait. If the brain cylinder contains a brain, the brain dies 3 rounds after it's removed or if the cylinder is left open for more than 10 minutes. You can transfer a brain from one brain cylinder to another with a @Check[type:medicine|dc:25|name:Transfer Brain] (expert) or Occultism (expert) check. This is a two-action activity with the manipulate trait. On a critical failure, the brain dies.</p>"

			"description": "<p><em>Briar</em> was formed ages ago by the Eldest when they tore from Nyrissa's mind and spirit her capability to love, then solidified this emotional energy into a sword. They entrusted <em>Briar's</em> safe keeping to the Lantern King, who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.</p>\n<p>When first recovered by the PCs, Briar is a <em>+3 greater striking cold iron bastard sword</em>, but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening Briar requires that the weapon be present when First World blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain-<em>Briar </em>need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World- including all creatures closely associated with a bloom-gives <em>Briar</em> a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.</p>\n<p>Once <em>Briar </em>gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. <em>Briar </em>knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the <em>Apology</em>, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen-see the end of Chapter 10.

The bird then follows the creature that activated it for up to one hour or until it is destroyed, doing its best to stay just above the creature and out of reach, and continuing its string of loud chirps.

		"Clockwork Disguise": {
			"name": "Clockwork Disguise",
			"description": "<p>Sometimes, just disguising one's face just isn't convincing enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there-or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they're out of proper uniform!</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such awkward, potentially fatal confrontations. The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user's torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by high-ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time, and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made of metal.</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +2; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +3; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-1; <strong>Strength</strong> 12; <strong>Group</strong> plate</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Transform the clockwork disguise into any one current preset configuration of the user's choice.</p>"

		"Clockwork Diving Suit": {
			"name": "Clockwork Diving Suit",
			"description": "<p>The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe. A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user to see what's going on in front of them.</p>\n<p>The suit's rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the user's range of movement and keeps them from moving faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit's back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it's activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit's belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances. This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface without walking to shore-it's too heavy to float on its own. Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back to the water's floor.</p>\n<p>The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal. This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the following stats:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +4; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +1; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-4; <strong>Speed Penalty</strong>-15 ft; <strong>Strength</strong> 18</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The diving suit shoots out a water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight line. The distance of this movement is unaffected by your swim Speed, if you have one, or the armor's Speed penalty. However, difficult terrain, such as the difficult terrain for moving up or down or moving against a current, still slows this movement</p>"

Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it-not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency- if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold.

Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar.

It deserves its reputation for dooming those who possess it to die, but scholars debate whether the codex causes this fate or merely acts as its harbinger.</p>\n<p>The Dullahan Codex is a jet-black tome bearing a single rune embossed on its cover, and it functions as a true endless grimoire. Inside, scrawled across its parchment pages in a delicate, spidery script, is a lengthy list of names that always appears in a reader's native alphabet. The grimoire isn't sentient, but it selects its owners, quickly passing out of the hands of those it doesn't choose.

(On a critical failure with this ritual, the codex adds all casters to its list.) You can redirect the curse by inscribing another person's name in the grimoire and succeeding at a @Check[type:arcana|dc:40] or Occultism check. Doing so is an evil act.

In reality, the prism refracts the four magical essences into the visible spectrum. A creature adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow from two input streams into the prism, where the prism combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until anyone reverses the prism's flow or finishes activating the prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is gently pushed back and out of the stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You alter and rearrange the facets of the essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality; vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane and occult magic both use mental essence).

At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism's first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to \"good\", one creature would have all the original creature's good aspects and the other would be the original creature's evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower.

The new creature is an amalgam of the originals, with a new personality blended from both, and is usually 1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the original creatures unless the lower-level creature was much weaker.

The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a secret Thievery check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a @Check[type:perception|dc:15|traits:action:seek] check-the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>"

Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of Gauntlight's levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.</p>\n<p>As an artifact, Gauntlight can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>\n<p>In Gauntlight's current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus Nhimbaloth's baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them—the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in “Eyes of Empty Death,” the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>To activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in “Eyes of Empty Death”).

The light saturates the region, causing any corpses in the area or within 10 feet of the surface of the illuminated area to animate as level -1 undead (typically as skeleton guards or zombie shamblers). Once animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully restored, the undead instead animate as any Common undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong><span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight's lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile.

It's a hollow black-rubber ball with small, flexible twin tubes sticking out from its center. Sealed within the rubber ball is vapor made from a mixture of evaporated holy water and a special type of incense smoke. The tube's twin prongs are placed into the user's nostrils, after which the user squeezes the rubber ball to activate the device, forcing the vapor into the user's body through their nose. The holy power contained within the vapor strengthens the user's will against creatures that are weak to holy water, making it tougher for malevolent creatures to subvert the user's mind.</p>\n<p>When the <em>holy steam ball</em> was first introduced in Mendev fifty years ago, few trusted it's efficacy. The nation had seen many charlatans peddle so-called \"anti-demon\" products, and most thought this was no different. Only when soldiers of the Mendevian Crusades used the ball and personally testified to its effectiveness did suspicion gave way to enthusiastic use. Nobody remembers who first invented the <em>holy steam ball</em>; they're likely lost to history because most initially thought it was a scam. After receiving endorsement from the Mendevian Crusade, a team of alchemists and inventors were able to determine the vapor's exact composition and mass produce them. The <em>holy steam ball</em>'s highly specialized purpose kept it from widespread use outside of the nations that once bordered the Worldwound. Yet with the return of the Whispering Tyrant in the past few years, the growing undead threat presents a new opportunity for more citizens to use <em>holy steam balls</em> for protection against the mind control powers of vampires and other undead.</p>\n<p>After using a <em>holy steam ball</em>, you must refill it before the next use in a process that takes five minutes to complete.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The <em>holy steam ball</em> is filled with evaporated holy water and incense smoke</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You release the stored steam and smoke to grant yourself its protections.

Legends state the Crowned Regent Kaldemash helped forge one of the first star guns millennia ago. While the star gun served Kaldemash as a powerful weapon, its most notable achievement was the accidental killing of one of Kaldemash's greatest friends. This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em>.</p>\n<p>The legendary weapon is a +3 major striking speed advanced firearm with a range increment of 90 feet. It deals 4d6 force damage (with the major striking rune included) and has the concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. You don't take a penalty when dealing nonlethal damage with the weapon. Like most star guns, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> uses magic to function and doesn't require ammunition or black powder.</p>\n<p>If you use <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as part of a duel in which all parties are in agreement on the terms, the gun's supernatural instincts help you make the quickest draw. You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a fortune effect. In addition, you can draw <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel. If you attempt to fire the star gun in bad faith at a dueling opponent once they have surrendered, been defeated, or the duel is over, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> flies out of your hand and you can't pick it up, hold it, or wield it for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">f</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You target a creature with an attack</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You adjust the damage that <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> deals before firing. <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em>'s damage type changes to either electricity, fire, or force until you change the type again.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You leave <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> to fire on its own. You release the star gun and it begins to move independently, flying through the air and firing. You still gain the benefits of the gun's speed rune while it's moving independently. It has a space of 5 feet but doesn't block or impede enemies attempting to move through that space. It always remains within 30 feet of you and intentionally resists being taken or otherwise moved; all attempts to Grab it fail. <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> moves this way for 3 rounds, after which it returns to your hand. If you don't have a free hand to hold it, the gun instead holsters itself on your person.</p>\n<p>While <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> is moving independently, you can command it to make a Strike against a creature as an action, which has the concentrate trait. It makes a ranged Strike using your attack modifier while wielding it or a +31 bonus, whichever is higher. This attack increases your multiple attack penalty as normal, and the gun uses your multiple attack penalty when determining its attack bonus. Since the star gun is constantly moving and attempting to line up the appropriate shot, creatures it targets are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} to the gun's attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You unleash a barrage of attacks in an instant.

It consists of two flat metal squares, one larger than the other, connected by a tube of leather similar to that found on a bellows. The smaller square, which sits at the front of the device, has a small glass lens in the center of it. The larger square contains a specially treated metallic plate on the inside; its exterior also has both a small control stick connected via flexible wire, and a small metal tube attached to the top and pointing forward. The user presses a button on the control stick to activate the light writer. Upon activation, magical light illuminates the tube, producing a steady light for 20 minutes. This light is captured by the lens and projected onto the metal plate, slowly creating an image of the scene in front of the lens. The plate can then be removed, allowing the image to be displayed anywhere the owner desires. The light writer is mounted on a tripod and must be perfectly still during operation to prevent any defects from appearing in the plate image. If creating a captured image of a living creature, it is equally important for that creature to remain still throughout the process, to avoid a ghostlike blurring of the final image</p>"

Arranged within these chambers are various items referred to as the palace's nodes-statues, tapestries, fountains, and other works of art are common, but a node can take other forms at the GM's discretion. As a 10‑minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure. When you do, the node changes its shape and appearance to visually represent the memory you have imprinted onto it. If the node was already imprinted with a memory, the old one can be overwritten to repurpose the node.</p>\n<p>Memories you have imprinted on a node can be mentally accessed at any time by a creature holding the <em>memory palace</em> in its miniature form, regardless of who imprinted them. This grants a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM's discretion, but a node shouldn't grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with Recall Knowledge checks for such trees, but it wouldn't grant the benefits for all Nature checks to Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<p>A <em>memory palace</em> node can also store the text from a spellbook or magical tome, but these memories aren't a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can't prepare spells from a <em>memory palace</em>, though they could use it as source material to try to Learn a Spell. However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the memory palace, few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren't real, and thus don't cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger. Many <em>memory palaces</em> have leftover memories from previous users-now long dead-imprinted on their various nodes.</p>"

The ruby-eyed, leering devil's face that surrounds the barrel was intended to strike fear into the Countess's opponents-of which there were many. Countess Tasya credited this weapon with her exceptional success in dueling circles and refused to name the weapon's creators for fear their works would fall into an opponent's hands. In the past decade, seven replicas of the Countess's famed pistol have arisen, each said to be crafted by the Countess's anonymous gunsmiths. That each of these weapon's wielders have quickly risen to become exceptional duelists in their own right has lent credence to their claims. Despite public pressure, wielders of these replicas have refused to square off against the Countess.</p>\n<p>Despite the weapon's beauty and utility, a <em>pact-bound pistol</em> is a cursed weapon and a physical manifestation of an infernal contract sworn between the bearer of the weapon and the Archdevil Mephistopheles. Each <em>pact-bound pistol</em> was crafted not by a team of master artisans, but by Countess Tasya Iserav herself, a secret diabolist and devoted priestess of The Crimson Son. The very act of firing the weapon is an acceptance of the contract's terms and causes the weapon to fuse to you. Thereafter, the weapon reappears in your possessions within 1 minute of you discarding it, and can't be destroyed or thrown away permanently, until the curse is removed.</p>\n<p>Whenever you attack a living creature with the <em>pact-bound pistol</em>, text from the infernal contract is seared into your flesh, causing you to lose 1 Hit Point, or 2 Hit Points if the attack was a critical success.

When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist's fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life.

The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature's unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon's Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature's DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature's physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability.

Anyone can Interact to grab the hole by the edges and partially or fully fold it up. This closes the entrance to the extradimensional space. Any objects or creatures within the hole remain inside, and any that can't fit fully inside are ejected into the nearest open space.

			"name": "The Whispering Reeds",
			"description": "<p>This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p>The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death).

That undead creature takes 5d6 positive damage (@Check[type:will|dc:27|basic:true] save) as portions of their incorporeal being are consumed in patches of seven equally spaced holes. Each time you use this ability after the first in a 24-hour period, you are exposed to the Empty Death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You invoke a tale from The Whispering Reeds that parallels the situation, environment, or creatures nearby. Eerie mists and indistinct whispers rise in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:20] around you, and clusters of seven perfectly spaced divots manifest in the ground, vegetation, and flesh of creatures in the emanation other than yourself and up to three creatures you designate at the time of activation. Creatures afflicted with these divots suffer from agonizing mental anguish in the form of crippling despair and take 4d6 mental damage (@Check[type:will|dc:27|basic:true] save). The mists, whispers, and strange divots fade away at the end of the round, but any creature that takes mental damage from the effect also takes a -1 penalty to saving throws against effects with the emotion trait for 1 minute.

If you die while affected by the Empty Death, you immediately become a chaotic evil ghost. Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:2]— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth. A creature whose ghost is consumed in this way does not travel to the River of Souls and is utterly annihilated; this creature can only be restored to life via a 10th-level spell effect or ritual like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Copies of The Whispering Reeds have no special protections and can be destroyed like any regular book, but doing so exposes the one who destroyed the book to the Empty Death.</p>"

It appears as a 5‑foot‑tall, 2‑foot‑wide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the <em>Void Mirror</em> functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the <em>Void Mirror</em> is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the <em>Void Mirror</em> functional.</p>\n<p>The view presented by the <em>Void Mirror</em> is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day. Observations of the sky in this way add a +3 item bonus to Astronomy Lore or Perception checks made while using the mirror. The point of view can be shifted through hand gestures, causing the scene within the mirror to reorient in any direction desired.</p>\n<p>A character who peers into the starscape within the <em>Void Mirror</em> must attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:41] save.

The character is then temporarily immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>By placing the <em>Void Mirror</em> in a specially-constructed frame, it can halt the ongoing transformation of a creature that has performed the apotheosis activation. Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in Crafting.</p>\n<p>The <em>Void Mirror</em> can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be Researched separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the <em>Void Mirror</em> in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets. Each requires a separate number of Occultism checks to Research, as detailed below for each activation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making @Check[type:occultism|dc:20] (expert) checks when Researching (1 week per attempt)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The first activation ritual is known as \"Speak to the Void\" and allows the user to contact an intelligence in a distant part of the universe, provided the mirror shows that location (regardless of distance). This alien intelligence infuses the user's mind with answers, allowing the user to Recall Knowledge using Nature or Occultism as if they were legendary proficiency with the skill (including the +8 proficiency bonus).

The creature's initial attitude toward the user is helpful, but this attitude can shift quickly if the creature realizes its goals and personality differs dramatically from the user's, or if the user makes a request of the creature that's against its nature. As long both the creature and the user are within 30 feet of the <em>Void Mirror</em>, the user can return the creature to its original location by Dismissing this activation. The creature can attempt a Will save against the user's Occultism DC to resist being returned; if it succeeds, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the creature is indifferent upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the creature is hostile upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but magical feedback from the failed activation causes the user to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 3}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 7 days (Interact)</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making @Check[type:occultism|dc:40] (legendary) checks when Researching (1 year per attempt)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per century</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The third activation ritual is known as \"Become the Void\" and requires the user to continue performing the rite for 7 consecutive days (as if they were performing a multi-day ritual). If the user fails to perform this rite for one of these 7 consecutive days, they immediately suffer the critical failure effect below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The user's body, mind, and soul are infused with alien energies drawn from the Dark Tapestry, which transforms the user into an aberration of a level no higher than their current level +4. This new form could be an existing aberration or a unique one of the GM's creation. The user retains their memories and spellcasting ability (including any rituals they know) but becomes chaotic evil and loses all other abilities they possessed in their previous form.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the aberration the user transforms into can be of a level no higher than half the user's current level.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The user's attempt to change is a painful mistake that deals [[/r (10d6+40)[bludgeoning]]] damage as their body twists, bends and breaks. Ultimately, they are not transformed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The user is slain, but their body shifts and transforms into a brand new creature as the bodiless alien intelligence Tchekuth incubates within the user's flesh, mind and soul. This transformation takes another 7 days to complete but can be halted indefinitely if the <em>Void Mirror</em> is placed in a specially constructed frame aimed at the body's location (regardless of any solid object between the mirror and the body). Slowing or stopping this transformation via other means requires complex rituals or divine intervention, subject to the GM's whim. After 7 days, the body completes its transformation and Tchekuth rises once more as a physical threat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A creature that completes the apotheosis of Becoming the Void can destroy the <em>Void Mirror</em> by smashing it, though doing so also destroys the creature performing this action in a violent burst of occult energy.</p>"
