                    "text": "<p>You'll notice some changes to the pathfinder system with this update. With the release of Rage of Elements we also received our first preview of the Pathfinder remastered rules. These changes are mostly in how things are named, with no mechanical impact. For example, you'll notice that the \"Flat-Footed\" condition is now renamed to \"Off-Guard\". You can read more of these changes in the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfinder/corepreview\">Pathfinder Core Preview Document</a>. If you are unaware of the motivation for these changes, it was prompted by the need to remove terminology from the game used by a different company's game system.</p><p>We want to make moving to the remastered version as smooth as possible for users, and for most groups these changes will have no impact. The new rules are compatible with the old rules, and all outward appearances are that this is mostly a renaming of items. The mechanical changes will not be integrated into the system until we have guidance on how to implement them with no interruption to gameplay. Going forward we plan to follow direction from Paizo and treat the remastered rules as errata to the game. We do not plan on removing any NPCs from the system, though in the future some names may change. There is no need to worry about something simply vanishing entirely on you or your group. We're players and GMs too, and we understand that some groups may be averse to changes, even ones that are just terminology changes.</p><p>We have added the new spells found in the preview document, including renaming some existing spells. If the mechanics of the spell changed in a way that it was not clear if it was meant as a replacement for an existing spell, then we kept the original spell as well as the spell intended to fill a similar function. For example, the <em>Ignition</em> spell is a new fire cantrip but because the mechanics of that cantrip are different than <em>Produce Flame</em> and the Psychic class interacts with the mechanics of produce flame directly, both spells have been kept in the system. But the new spell <em>Falling Stars</em> is a direct mechanical replacement for <em>Meteor Swarm</em>. Compendium entries of <em>Meteor Swarm</em> were renamed, and the mechanics of that spell updated to <em>Falling Stars</em>. Existing links to <em>Meteor Swarm</em> will now point to <em>Falling Stars</em>, but copies of the spell on actors were not removed or altered. For ease of reference here is a list of all spells that have had their names changed:</p><ul><li><em>Barkskin</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.YWrfKetOqDwVFut7]{Oaken Resilience}</em>.</li><li><em>Burning Hands</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.y6rAdMK6EFlV6U0t]{Breathe Fire}</em>.</li><li><em>Calm Emotions</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.b515AZlB0sridKSq]{Calm}</em>.</li><li><em>Comprehend Languages</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vTQvfYu2llKQedmY]{Translate}</em>.</li><li><em>Dimension Door</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]{Translocate}</em>.</li><li><em>Dimensional Lock</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XZE4BawIlTf88Yl9]{Planar Seal}</em>.</li><li><em>Endure Elements</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5esP2GVzvxWsMgaX]{Environmental Endurance}</em>.</li><li><em>Entangle</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.J6vNvrUT3b1hx2iA]{Entangling Flora}</em>.</li><li><em>Flesh to Stone</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.znv4ECL7ZtuiagtA]{Petrify}</em>.</li><li><em>Gaseous Form</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.V8wXOsoejQhe6CyG]{Vapor Form}</em>.</li><li><em>Gentle Repose</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.xRgU9rrhmGAgG4Rc]{Peaceful Rest}</em>.</li><li><em>Know Direction</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tXa5vOu5giBNCjdR]{Know the Way}</em>.</li><li><em>Longstrider</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.KcLVELhCUcKXxiKE]{Tailwind}</em>.</li><li><em>Mage Armor</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.aAbfKn8maGjJjk2W]{Mystic Armor}</em>.</li><li><em>Mage Hand</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pwzdSlJgYqN7bs2w]{Telekinetic Hand}</em>.</li><li><em>Magic Fang</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.EE7Q5BHIrfWNCPtT]{Runic Body}</em>.</li><li><em>Magic Weapon</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.TFitdEOpQC4SzKQQ]{Runic Weapon}</em>.</li><li><em>Meld into Stone</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vh1RpbWfqdNC4L3P]{One with Stone}</em>.</li><li><em>Meteor Swarm</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.jrBa9deU2ULFWvSl]{Falling Stars}</em>.</li><li><em>Plane Shift</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.nRINcQb81Wt4KeFu]{Interplanar Teleport}</em>.</li><li><em>Purify Food and Drink</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.qXTB7Ec9yYh5JPPV]{Cleanse Cuisine}</em>.</li><li><em>Scorching Ray</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ZxHC7V7HtjUsB8zH]{Blazing Bolt}</em>.</li><li><em>See Invisibility</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.jwK43yKsHTkJQvQ9]{See the Unseen}</em>.</li><li><em>Stoneskin</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.2BV2yYPfVJ5zirZt]{Mountain Resilience}</em>.</li><li><em>Tanglefoot</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.uZK2BYzPnxUBnDjr]{Tangle Vine}</em>.</li><li><em>Tongues</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SwUiVavHKMWG7t5K]{Truespeech}</em>.</li><li><em>Tree Shape</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dileJ0Yxqg76LMvu]{One with Plants}</em>.</li><li><em>Tree Stride</em> is now <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.F1qxaqsEItmBura2]{Nature's Pathway}</em>.</li></ul><p>Some spells have had their mechanics or text updated with no change to the name:</p><ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.41TZEjhO6D1nWw2X]{Augury}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl]{Detect Magic}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.YrzBLPLd3r9m6t1p]{Fire Shield}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.hghGRzOSzEl4UXdS]{Invoke Spirits}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.BBvV7qoXGdw09q1C]{Speak with Animals}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.qvwIwJ9QBihy8R0t]{Speak with Plants}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.nH3Rgzzv0b6IeKdd]{Speak with Stones}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish}</em></li></ul><p>You can also find the following new remaster spells in our compendiums.

In a situation like this, you can either place more useful treasure in the adventure or introduce NPCs who are willing to trade.</p>\n<h3>Megadungeons and Sandboxes</h3>\n<p>Some adventures have an expectation that the player characters explore where they want and find only what their skill, luck, and ingenuity afford. Two common examples of this type of adventure are the sprawling dungeon with multiple different sections and paths, often called a megadungeon, and free-form exploration, often called a sandbox and typically occurring in a wilderness. If you want to build a free-form adventure like this where characters are likely to miss at least some of the treasure, increase the amount of treasure you place. Be aware, however, that a meticulous group can end up with more treasure than normal and will have advantages in later adventures.</p><p>For a simple guideline to these situations, increase the treasure as though there were one more PC in the party. If the structure is especially loose, especially in sandbox adventures, you can increase this amount even further.</p>"

A single item on this table is always a baseline item. If the player wants armor or a weapon with property runes, they must buy the property runes separately, and for armor or a weapon made of a precious material, they must pay for the precious material separately as well.</p><p>These values are for a PC just starting out at the given level. If the PC is joining a party that has already made progress toward the next level, consider giving the new character an additional item of their current level. If your party has kept the treasure of dead or retired PCs and passed it on to new characters, you might need to give the new character less than the values on the table or reduce some of the treasure rewards of the next few adventures.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Item Selection</h2><p>You should work with the new character's player to decide which items their character has. Allow the player to make suggestions, and if they know what items they want their character to have, respect their choices unless you believe those choices will have a negative impact on your game. At your discretion, you can grant the player character uncommon or rare items that fit their backstory and concept, keeping in mind how many items of those rarities you have introduced into your game. The player can also spend currency on consumables or lower-level permanent items, keeping the rest as coinage. As usual, you determine which items the character can find for purchase.</p><p>A PC can voluntarily choose an item that has a lower level than any or all of the listed items, but they don't gain any more currency by doing so.</p><p>If you choose, you can allow the player to instead start with a lump sum of currency and buy whatever common items they want, with a maximum item level of 1 lower than the character's level. This has a lower total value than the normal allotment of permanent items and currency, since the player can select a higher ratio of high-level items.</p>"

If cover is especially light, typically when it's provided by a creature, you have lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover or greater cover can attempt to use Stealth to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, but lesser cover isn't sufficient.</p><p>Cover is relative, so you might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you don't have line of effect and typically can't target it at all.</p><p>Usually, the GM can quickly decide whether your target has cover. If you're uncertain or need to be more precise, draw a line from the center of your space to the center of the target's space. If that line passes through any terrain or object that would block the effect, the target has standard cover (or greater cover if the obstruction is extreme or the target has Taken Cover). If the line passes through a creature instead, the target has lesser cover. When measuring cover against an area effect, draw the line from the effect's point of origin to the center of the creature's space.</p><h2>Cover and Large Creatures</h2><p>If a creature between you and a target is two or more sizes larger than both you and your target, that creature's space blocks the effect enough to provide standard cover instead of lesser cover. The GM might determine that a creature doesn't gain cover from terrain that it's significantly larger than. For example, a Huge dragon probably wouldn't receive any benefit from being behind a 1-foot-wide pillar.</p><h2>Special Circumstances</h2><p>Your GM might allow you to overcome your target's cover in some situations. If you're right next to an arrow slit, you can shoot without penalty, but you have greater cover against someone shooting back at you from far away. Your GM might let you reduce or negate cover by leaning around a corner to shoot or the like. This usually takes an action to set up, and the GM might measure cover from an edge or corner of your space instead of your center.</p>"

Your maximum Hit Point value represents your health, wherewithal, and heroic drive when you are in good health and rested. Your maximum Hit Points include the Hit Points you gain at 1st level from your ancestry and class, those you gain at higher levels from your class, and any you gain from other sources (like the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AmP0qu7c5dlBSath]{Toughness} general feat). When you take damage, you reduce your current Hit Points by a number equal to the damage dealt.</p><p>Some spells, items, and other effects, as well as simply resting, can heal living or undead creatures. When you are healed, you regain Hit Points equal to the amount healed, up to your maximum Hit Points.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Knocked Out and Dying</h2><p>Creatures cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 Hit Points. When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which case they are instead knocked out for a significant amount of time (usually 1 minute or more). When undead and construct creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they are destroyed.</p><p>Player characters, their companions, and other significant characters and creatures don't automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points. Instead, they are knocked out and are at risk of death. At the GM's discretion, villains, powerful monsters, special NPCs, and enemies with special abilities that are likely to bring them back to the fight (like ferocity, regeneration, or healing magic) can use these rules as well.</p><p>As a player character, when you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you're knocked out with the following effects:</p><ul><li>You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.</li><li>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying 1} condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded} condition, increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value. If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don't gain the dying condition; you are instead @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} with 0 Hit Points.</li></ul><h2 class=\"title\">Taking Damage while Dying</h2><p>If you take damage while you already have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying} condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker's critical hit or your own critical failure. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded} condition, remember to add the value of your wounded condition to your dying value.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Recovery Checks</h2><p>When you're dying, at the start of each of your turns, you must attempt a flat check with a DC equal to 10 + your current dying value to see if you get better or worse. This is called a recovery check. The effects of this check are asfollows.</p><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 2.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> Your dying value is reduced by 1.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Your dying value increases by 2.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Conditions Related to Death and Dying</h2><p>To understand the rules for getting knocked out and how dying works in the game, you'll need some more information on the conditions used in those rules. Presented below are the rules for the dying, unconscious, wounded, and doomed conditions.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Dying</h3><p>You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. While you have this condition, you are unconscious. Dying always includes a value. If this value ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you're dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse.</p><p>If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described on page 460. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded value by 1 if you already have that condition.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Unconscious</h3><p>You're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a -4 status penalty to AC, Perception, and Reflex saves, and you have the blinded and off-guard conditions. When you gain this condition, you fall prone and drop items you are wielding or holding unless the effect states otherwise or the GM determines you're in a position in which you wouldn't.</p><p><strong>If you're unconscious because you're dying</strong>, you can't wake up as long as you have 0 Hit Points. If you're restored to 1 Hit Point or more via healing, you lose the dying and unconscious conditions and can act normally on your next turn.</p><p><strong>If you are unconscious and at 0 Hit Points, but not dying</strong>, you naturally return to 1 Hit Point and awaken after sufficient time passes. The GM determines how long you remain unconscious, from a minimum of 10 minutes to several hours. If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.</p><p><strong>If you're unconscious and have more than 1 Hit Point</strong> (typically because you are asleep or unconscious due to an effect), you wake up in one of the following ways. Each causes you to lose the unconscious condition.</p><ul><li>You take damage, provided the damage doesn't reduce you to 0 Hit Points. (If the damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious and gain the dying condition as normal.)</li><li>You receive healing, other than the natural healing you get from resting.</li><li>Someone nudges or shakes you awake using an Interact action.</li><li>Loud noise is being made around you\u2014though this isn't automatic. At the start of your turn, you automatically attempt a Perception check against the noise's DC (or the lowest DC if there is more than one noise), waking up if you succeed. This is often DC 5 for a battle, but if creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check uses their Stealth DC. Some magical effects make you sleep so deeply that they don't allow you to attempt this Perception check.</li><li>If you are simply asleep, the GM decides you wake up either because you have had a restful night's sleep or something disrupted that rest.</li></ul><h3 class=\"title\">Wounded</h3><p>You have been seriously injured during a fight. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you become wounded 1 if you didn't already have the wounded condition. If you already have the wounded condition, your wounded condition value instead increases by 1. If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase the dying condition's value by your wounded value. The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with Treat Wounds, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Doomed</h3><p>Your life is ebbing away, bringing you ever closer to death. Some powerful spells and evil creatures can inflict the doomed condition on you. Doomed always includes a value. The maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value. For example, if you were doomed 1, you would die upon reaching dying 3 instead of dying 4. If your maximum dying value is ever reduced to 0, you instantly die. When you die, you're no longer doomed.</p><p>Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night's rest.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Death</h2><p>After you die, you can't act or be affected by spells that target creatures (unless they specifically target dead creatures), and for all other purposes you are an object. When you die, you are reduced to 0 Hit Points if you had a different amount, and you can't be brought above 0 Hit Points as long as you remain dead. Some magic can bring creatures back to life, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kqhPt9344UkcGVYO]{Resurrect}</em> ritual or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.IkGYwHRLhkuoGReG]{Raise Dead}</em> spell.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Heroic Recovery</h2><p>If you have at least 1 Hero Point (page 467), you can spend all of your remaining Hero Points at the start of your turn or when your dying value would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Death Effects and Instant Death</h2><p>Some spells and abilities can kill you immediately or bring you closer to death without needing to reduce you to 0 Hit Points first. These abilities have the death trait and usually involve negative energy, the antithesis of life. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a death effect, you are slain instantly without needing to reach dying 4. If an effect states it kills you outright, you die without having to reach dying 4 and without being reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Massive Damage</h2><p>You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Hit Points in one blow.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Temporary Hit Points</h2><p>Some spells or abilities give you temporary Hit Points. Track these separately from your current and maximum Hit Points; when you take damage, reduce your temporary Hit Points first. Most temporary Hit Points last for a limited duration. You can't regain lost temporary Hit Points through healing, but you can gain more via other abilities. You can have temporary Hit Points from only one source at a time. If you gain temporary Hit Points when you already have some, choose whether to keep the amount you already have and their corresponding duration or to gain the new temporary Hit Points and their duration.</p>"

                    "name": "Deep Backgrounds",
                    "text": "<h1>Deep Backgrounds</h1><p>The decision of a character background is not necessarily a complicated one; the player simply selects from the available background options to reflect their character's life before adventuring. While this is a good method for determining a character's backstory, some players might want more insight into their character's early life or family.</p><h2>Using Deep Backgrounds</h2><p>This variant replaces Step 4 of Character Creation. The player rolls on the tables in this section to determine their character's family background, homeland, major childhood event, influential associate, relationships, and drawbacks. Each element of the player's background adds options to the final list of ability boosts, skills, feats, and other options that their background can grant. The player writes these options down as they build their character's background. At the end of the process, they select the following from among the options written down.</p><ul><li>Two ability boosts, each to a different ability score.</li><li>Training in a skill.</li><li>One skill feat (or possibly another feat or piece of equipment). If the player chooses a skill feat, they become trained in its prerequisite skill, or one of its possible prerequisite skills if it has multiple (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.IlOQuCQIhjJpig3S]{Quick Identification}). If the random results include a feat that isn't a skill feat and the player selects that feat, they don't gain training in a skill. If they choose a piece of equipment instead of a skill feat, the entry indicates what skill training, if any, they receive.</li></ul><h3>Rerolling and Selecting</h3><p>At your discretion, the players don't have to be bound by any results from the following tables. Depending on how your group wants to use deep backgrounds, players can reroll any result they don't like, or even select a specific option from a table that fits their emerging vision of their character. However, if you allow players to reroll or directly select options (and potentially even if you don't), you might want to exclude options that grant feats other than skill feats; these options are unusual enough that they might put too much pressure on players to select only these options. Note that the following tables reflect the <em>Core Rulebook</em> and the Age of Lost Omens setting\u2014if your game takes place in a different setting, feel free to adjust the tables or allow players to select the options that best fit your setting.</p><h2>Generating Deep Backgrounds</h2><p>As a player, follow the steps below to generate your character's deep background.</p><h3>Step 1: Family Background</h3><p>The word family means something different to everyone. You might have a biological family, adopted family, stepfamily, or any other kind and combination you choose; family bonds come in all types. To determine the number of family members you grew up with as an active part of your life, roll 1d% on the following table. Use the medium family for most ancestries, small if you're a half-elf or half-orc, and large if you're a goblin or halfling. For ancestries other than those in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, use the column that best suits the ancestry. It's up to you whether these family members are parents, siblings, grandparents, or other close relatives.</p><table class=\"pf2-table\"><caption><strong>TABLE: FAMILY SIZE</strong></caption><tbody><tr><td><strong>[[/r d100]]</strong></td><th><strong>Small Family</strong></th><th><strong>Medium Family</strong></th><th><strong>Large Family</strong></th></tr><tr><td>1-4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>5-8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>9-20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>21-34</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>35-39</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>40-50</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>51-60</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>61-65</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>66-69</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>70-78</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>79-80</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>81-87</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>88-90</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>91-93</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>94-95</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>96-97</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>98-99</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8+</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>8+</td><td>8+</td><td>8+</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>If you grew up with no family, you had to learn to survive on your own.

Roll on the following table to determine the nature of your homeland. If your character is a dwarf, subtract 3; if an elf, add 2; if a goblin, subtract 4.

This step is best performed when the entire group is sitting together and can generate and discuss these connections with each other. You should select another character and roll on the first table to generate an inspiring connection, then determine a different character and roll on the second table to generate a challenging connection. You might choose these characters randomly, or the group might decide that each character has an inspiring connection with the character of the player sitting to the left and a challenging connection with the character of the player sitting to the right.</p><p>Other players can reject a relationship connection they don't feel fits with their vision of their own character; in this case, pick another character or a different relationship.

However, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} conditions can partially mask a creature, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unnoticed} condition indicates you have no idea a creature is around.</p><p>With the exception of invisible, these conditions are relative to the viewer\u2014it's possible for a creature to be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed} to you but @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} from your ally. When you're trying to target a creature that's hard to see or otherwise sense, various drawbacks apply. Most of these rules apply to objects you're trying to detect as well as creatures.</p><p>Typically, the GM tracks how well creatures detect each other, since neither party has perfect information. For example, you might think a creature is in the last place you sensed it, but it was able to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak} away. Or you might think a creature can't see you in the dark, but it has darkvision.</p><p>You can attempt to avoid detection by using the Stealth skill to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Avoid Notice}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}, or by using Deception to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.GkmbTGfg8KcgynOA]{Create a Diversion}.</p><h3>Observed</h3><p>In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}. Observing requires a precise sense, which for most creatures means sight, but see the @UUID[.jEf21wTIEXzGtPU6]{Detecting with Other Senses} sidebar for advice regarding creatures that don't use sight as their primary sense. If you can't observe the creature, it's either @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unnoticed}, and you'll need to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}, it might still be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}.</p><h3>Hidden</h3><p>A creature that's hidden is only barely perceptible. You know what space a hidden creature occupies, but little else. Perhaps the creature just moved behind cover and successfully used the Hide action. Your target might be in a deep fogbank or behind a waterfall, where you can see some movement but can't determine an exact location. Maybe you've been @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} or the creature is under the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Invisibility}</em>, but you used the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} basic action to determine its general location based on hearing alone. Regardless of the specifics, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} to a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} creature.</p><p>When targeting a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} creature, before you roll to determine your effect, you must attempt a DC 11 flat check. If you fail, you don't affect the creature, though the actions you used are still expended\u2014as well as any spell slots, costs, and other resources. You remain off-guard to the creature, whether you successfully target it or not.</p><h3>Undetected</h3><p>If a creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}, you don't know what space it occupies, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} to it, and you can't easily target it. Using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} basic action can help you find an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creature, usually making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} from you instead of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}. If a creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}, that doesn't necessarily mean you're unaware of its presence\u2014you might suspect an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creature is in the room with you, even though you're unable to find its space. The unnoticed condition covers creatures you're entirely unaware of.</p><p>Targeting an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creature is difficult. If you suspect there's a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt an attack. This works like targeting a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} creature, but the flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM. The GM won't tell you why you missed\u2014whether it was due to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other abilities in a similar fashion. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} creatures are subject to area effects normally.</p><p>For instance, suppose an enemy elf wizard cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Invisibility}</em> and then @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneaked} away. You suspect that with the elf's Speed of 30 feet, they probably moved 15 feet toward an open door. You move up and attack a space 15 feet from where the elf started and directly on the path to the door. The GM secretly rolls an attack roll and flat check, but they know that you were not quite correct\u2014the elf was actually in the adjacent space! The GM tells you that you missed, so you decide to make your next attack on the adjacent space, just in case. This time, it's the right space, and the GM's secret attack roll and flat check both succeed, so you hit!</p><h3>Unnoticed</h3><p>If you have no idea a creature is even present, that creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unnoticed} by you. A creature that is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected} might also be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9evPzg9E6muFcoSk]{Unnoticed}.

For many special senses, a player can describe how they're avoiding detection by that special sense and use the most applicable Stealth action. For instance, a creature stepping lightly to avoid being detected via tremorsense would be using Sneak.</p><p>In some cases, rolling a Dexterity-based Stealth skill check to Sneak doesn't make the most sense. For example, when facing a creature that can detect heartbeats, a PC trying to avoid being detected might meditate to slow their heart rate, using Wisdom instead of Dexterity as the ability modifier for the Stealth check. When a creature that can detect you has multiple senses, such as if it could also hear or see, the PC would use the lowest applicable ability modifier for the check.</p>"

The following sections offer advice on how to set appropriate DCs and tweak them as needed to feel natural for your story. Picking a simple DC and using a level-based DC each work well in certain circumstances, and you can adjust both types of DC using the advice on adjusting difficulty.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Simple DCs</h2><p>Sometimes you need to quickly set a Difficulty Class. The easiest method is to select a simple DC from Table 10-4 by estimating which proficiency rank best matches the task (that rank is usually not required to succeed at the task). If it's something pretty much anyone would have a decent chance at, use the untrained DC. If it would require a degree of training, use the DC listed for trained, expert, master, or legendary proficiency, as appropriate to the complexity of the task. For example, say a PC was trying to uncover the true history behind a fable. You determine this requires a check to Recall Knowledge, and that only someone with master proficiency in Folktale Lore would know the information, so you'd set the DC at 30\u2014the simple master DC.</p><p>Simple DCs work well when you need a DC on the fly and there's no level associated with the task. They're most useful for skill checks. Because there isn't much gradation between the simple DCs, they don't work as well for hazards or combatants, where the PCs' lives are on the line; you're better off using level-based DCs for such challenges.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Level-Based DCs</h2><p>When you're determining a skill DC based on something that has a level, use Table 10-5 to set the DC. Find the level of the subject, and assign the corresponding DC. Since spells use a 1-10 scale, use the Spell Level column for them.</p><p>Use these DCs when a PC needs to Identify a Spell or Recall Knowledge about a creature, attempts to Earn Income by performing a task of a certain level, and so on. You can also use the level-based DCs for obstacles instead of assigning a simple DC. For example, you might determine that a wall in a high-level dungeon was constructed of smooth metal and is hard to climb. You could simply say only someone with master proficiency could climb it, and use the simple DC of 30. Or you might decide that the 15th-level villain who created the dungeon crafted the wall, and use the 15th-level DC of 34. Either approach is reasonable!</p><p>Note that PCs who invest in a skill become more likely to succeed at a DC of their level as they increase in level, and the listed DCs eventually become very easy for them.</p><h2>Adjusting Difficulty</h2><p>You might decide a DC should differ from the baseline, whether to account for PCs' areas of expertise or to represent the rarity of spells or items. A DC adjustment represents an essential difference in the difficulty of a task and applies to anyone attempting a specific check for it. Adjustments happen most often with tasks whose DCs are based on their level. Adjustments use a scale of -10 to +10, from incredibly easy checks to incredibly hard ones, and are broken into increments of 2, 5, and 10. You'll often apply the adjustments for uncommon, rare, or unique subjects.</p><p>The adjustments' names don't translate to how hard a task actually is for a PC or group of PCs, and adjustments aren't meant to balance out or replace PCs' bonuses and penalties. PCs who invest in a skill will become better and better at that skill as they increase in level. For example, even the best 1st-level PC has grim odds against an incredibly hard 1st-level DC, with a huge chance of critical failure, but by 20th level, an optimized character with a modicum of magic or assistance can take down incredibly hard 20th-level DCs over half the time, critically failing only on a 1. At higher levels, many groups will find that the very hard DC is more like standard for them; keep that in mind if you need a check that presents a true challenge to a high level group.</p><p>You might use different DCs for a task based on the particular skill or statistic used for the check. Let's say your PCs encounter a magical tome about aberrant creatures. The tome is 4th-level and has the occult trait, so you set the DC of an Occultism check to Identify the Magic to 19, based on Table 10-5. As noted in Identify Magic, other magic-related skills can typically be used at a higher DC, so you might decide the check is very hard for a character using Arcana and set the DC at 24 for characters using that skill. If a character in your group had Aberration Lore, you might determine that it would be easy or very easy to use that skill and adjust the DC to 17 or 14. These adjustments aren't taking the place of characters' bonuses, modifiers, and penalties\u2014they are due to the applicability of the skills being used.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Group Attempts</h3><p>The DCs in this chapter give an individual character a strong and increasing chance of success if they have some proficiency. On occasion, though, you'll have a task that only one person in the group needs to succeed at, but that everyone can attempt. The number of dice being rolled means that there's a very high chance at least one of them will succeed. Most of the time, that's perfectly fine, but sometimes you'll want the task to be a challenge, with some uncertainty as to whether the party can succeed. In these cases, make the check very hard, or incredibly hard if you want it to be particularly difficult or at high levels. At these DCs, most of the party will probably fail, but someone will probably still succeed, likely a character who has heavily invested in the given skill, as is expected for specialized characters.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Minimum Proficiency</h2><p>Sometimes succeeding at a particular task requires a character to have a specific proficiency rank in addition to a success on the check. Locks and traps often require a certain proficiency rank to successfully use the Pick a Lock or Disable a Device actions of Thievery. A character whose proficiency rank is lower than what's listed can attempt the check, but they can't succeed. You can apply similar minimum proficiencies to other tasks. You might decide, for example, that a particular arcane theorem requires training in Arcana to understand. An untrained barbarian can't succeed at the check, but she can still attempt it if she wants\u2014after all, she needs to have a chance to critically fail and get erroneous information!</p><p>For checks that require a minimum proficiency, keep the following guidelines in mind. A 2nd-level or lower task should almost never require expert proficiency, a 6th-level or lower task should almost never require master proficiency, and a 14th-level or lower task should almost never require legendary proficiency. If they did, no character of the appropriate level could succeed.</p>"

You can usually read a formula as long as you can read the language it's written in, though you might lack the skill to Craft the item. Often, alchemists and crafting guilds use obscure languages or create codes to protect their formulas from rivals.</p><p>You can buy common formulas at the Price listed on Table 6-13, or you can hire an NPC to let you copy their formula for the same Price. A purchased formula is typically a schematic on rolled-up parchment of light Bulk. You can copy a formula into your formula book in 1 hour, either from a schematic or directly from someone else's formula book. If you have a formula, you can Craft a copy of it using the Crafting skill. Formulas for uncommon items and rare items are usually significantly more valuable\u2014if you can find them at all!</p><p>If you have an item, you can try to reverse-engineer its formula. This uses the Craft activity and takes the same amount of time as creating the item from a formula would. You must first disassemble the item. After the base downtime, you attempt a Crafting check against the same DC it would take to Craft the item. If you succeed, you Craft the formula at its full Price, and you can keep working to reduce the Price as normal. If you fail, you're left with raw materials and no formula. If you critically fail, you also waste 10% of the raw materials you'd normally be able to salvage.</p><p>The item's disassembled parts are worth half its Price in raw materials and can't be reassembled unless you successfully reverse-engineer the formula or acquire the formula another way. Reassembling the item from the formula works just like Crafting it from scratch; you use the disassembled parts as the necessary raw materials.</p>"

Unlike most aspects of your character, which persist over the long term, Hero Points last for only a single session.</p><p>The GM is in charge of awarding Hero Points (guidelines for doing so can be found on page 507). Usually, each character gets 1 Hero Point at the start of a session and can gain more later by performing heroic deeds\u2014something selfless, daring, or beyond normal expectations. You can have a maximum of 3 Hero Points at a time, and you lose any remaining Hero Points at the end of a session.</p><p>You can spend your Hero Points in one of two ways. Neither of these is an action, and you can spend Hero Points even if you aren't able to act. You can spend a Hero Point on behalf of your familiar or animal companion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spend 1 Hero Point</strong> to reroll a check. You must use the second result. This is a fortune effect (which means you can't use more than 1 Hero Point on acheck).</li>\n<li><strong>Spend all your Hero Points</strong> (minimum 1) to avoid death. You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points. You don't gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don't lose it or decrease its value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Describing Heroic Deeds</h2>\n<p>Because spending Hero Points reflects heroic deeds or tasks that surpass normal expectations, if you spend a Hero Point, you should describe the deed or task your character accomplishes with it to the other players.</p><p>Your character's deed might invoke a lesson learned in a past adventure, could be spurred by a determination to save someone else, or might depend on an item that ended up on their person due to a previous exploit. If you don't want to describe the deed or don't have any strong ideas about how to do so, ask the GM to come up with something for you. This can be a collaborative process, too. The GM might remind you of a long-forgotten event in the campaign, and all you have to do is fill in how that event comes to mind just at the right time, motivating you to push past your limits.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hero Points (Rewards)</h2>\n<p>Unlike Experience Points and treasure, which stay with a character, Hero Points are granted and used on a per-session basis. At the start of a game session, you give out 1 Hero Point to each player character. You can also give out more Hero Points during the game, typically after a heroic moment or accomplishment (see below). As noted on page 467, a player can spend 1 Hero Point for a reroll, or they can spend all their Hero Points to recover when near death.</p><p>In a typical game, you'll hand out about 1 Hero Point during each hour of play after the first (for example, 3 extra points in a 4-hour session). If you want a more over-the-top game, or if your group is up against incredible odds and showing immense bravery, you might give them out at a faster rate, like 1 every 30 minutes (6 over a 4-hour session). Try to ensure each PC has opportunities to earn Hero Points, and avoid granting all of the Hero Points to a single character.</p><p>Brave last stands, protecting innocents, and using a smart strategy or spell to save the day could all earn a character a Hero Point. Look for those moments when everybody at the table celebrates or sits back in awe of a character's accomplishments; that's your cue to issue that character a Hero Point.</p><p>The party could also gain Hero Points for their accomplishments throughout the game. For a moderate or major accomplishment, consider giving out a Hero Point as well. This point typically goes to a PC who was instrumental in attaining that accomplishment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Hero Points (GMG Advice)</h2>\n<p>Page 507 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> offers guidelines for determining how many Hero Points to award and when to do so. These recommendations are flexible. Consider Hero Points a way to reinforce your personal style of Game Mastering and to reward what you value during play. The toughest part of awarding Hero Points can be remembering to do it! Keeping a Hero Point token on hand in front of you can provide a visual and tactile reminder. You can also solicit help from your players by asking them to remind you when they think a PC's action merits a Hero Point.</p>"

Sometimes an item is even less sturdy than the Hardness and Hit Points provided for a thin object; for instance, a twig doesn't take 9 damage to break, even though it's made of thin wood.

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature.

If the victim @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escapes} this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p><p>If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.baA0nSMhQyFyJIia]{Swarm Mind}</h2><p>This monster doesn't have a single mind (typically because it's a swarm of smaller creatures), and is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures.

This is a significant change to the system.</p><p>The proficiency rank progression in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> is designed for heroic fantasy games where heroes rise from humble origins to world-shattering strength. For some games, this narrative arc doesn't fit. Such games are about hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which even the world's best fighter can't guarantee a win against a large group of moderately skilled brigands. In games like these, your group might want to consider removing the character's level from the proficiency bonus.</p><p>The initial implementation is fairly straightforward: the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. We recommend giving an untrained character a -2 proficiency modifier instead of a +0 proficiency bonus.</p><p>Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element. These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks, ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells.</p><p>Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks to account for the level being removed. You can just subtract the level from the DC tables in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, or you can reference Table: Simple Skill DCs (No Level) for a set of DCs that's easier to remember. The new DCs make it a little harder for high-level characters to succeed than it would be when using the default numbers from the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, in keeping with the theme mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to flatten out, with critical successes and critical failures being less likely across the game. This is particularly notable in spells, where you're less likely to see the extreme effects of critical failures on saves.</p><h3>Adjusting Encounters</h3><p>Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and conversely, a single higher-level monster is not much of a threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in encounter building, including shifts in the PCs' rewards.</p><p>Under the math in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, two monsters of a certain level are roughly as challenging as a single monster 2 levels higher. However, with level removed from proficiency, this assumption is no longer true. The XP budget for creatures uses a different scale, as shown in Table: Creature XP (No Level). You'll still use the same XP budget for a given threat level as shown on @UUID[.9hfEG4kJmEbrjGS1]{Encounter Building &amp; XP Awards} (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for a severe-threat encounter, and so on).</p><h3>Table: Creature XP (No Level)</h3><p>While the XP values in Table: Creature XP (No Level) work well in most cases, sometimes they might not account for the effects of creatures' special abilities when facing a party of a drastically different level. For instance, a ghost mage could prove too much for 5th-level PCs with its incorporeality, flight, and high-level spells, even though it's outnumbered.</p><h3>Adjusting Treasure</h3><p>Treasure and the cost of items in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to build encounters without worrying about awarding too much or too little treasure based on whether you use creatures who carry items. However, using this variant, the PCs might defeat a creature 5 levels higher than they are, or even more! Too many encounters with higher-level foes can wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected, or vice-versa if they're fighting weaker foes that put up more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can nudge this in the right direction by making periodic adjustments if the PCs' treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making it so they can't easily sell or buy magic items will mean it's harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep the treasure economy entirely, you can use the @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{Automatic Bonus Progression}.</p>"

                    "text": "<p>The ways a creature can use Perception depend on what senses it has. The primary concepts you need to know for understanding senses are precise senses, imprecise senses, and the three states of detection a target can be in:@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VRSef5y1LmL2Hkjf]{Undetected}. Vision, hearing, and scent are three prominent senses, but they don't have the same degree of acuity.</p>\n<h2>Precise Senses</h2>\n<p>Average vision is a precise sense\u2014a sense that can be used to perceive the world in nuanced detail. The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense. You can usually detect a creature automatically with a precise sense unless that creature is hiding or obscured by the environment, in which case you can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} basic action to better detect the creature.</p>\n<h2>Imprecise Senses</h2>\n<p>Hearing is an imprecise sense\u2014it cannot detect the full range of detail that a precise sense can. You can usually sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but it has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} condition instead of the observed condition. It might be undetected by you if it's using Stealth or is in an environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one you didn't even know was there) merely @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}\u2014it can't make the creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}.</p>\n<h2>Vague Senses</h2>\n<p>A character also has many vague senses\u2014ones that can alert you that something is there but aren't useful for zeroing in on it to determine exactly what it is. The most useful of these for a typical character is the sense of smell. At best, a vague sense can be used to detect the presence of an unnoticed creature, making it undetected. Even then, the vague sense isn't sufficient to make the creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.1wQY3JYyhMYeeV2G]{Observed}.</p><p>When one creature might detect another, the GM almost always uses the most precise sense available.</p><p>Pathfinder's rules assume that a given creature has vision as its only precise sense and hearing as its only imprecise sense. Some characters and creatures, however, have precise or imprecise senses that don't match this assumption. For instance, a character with poor vision might treat that sense as imprecise, an animal with the scent ability can use its sense of smell as an imprecise sense, and a creature with echolocation or a similar ability can use hearing as a precise sense. Such senses are often given special names and appear as \u201cecholocation (precise),\u201d \u201cscent (imprecise) 30 feet,\u201d or the like.</p>\n<h1>Special Senses</h1>\n<p>While a human might have a difficult time making creatures out in dim light, an elf can see those creatures just fine. And though elves have no problem seeing on a moonlit night, their vision cannot penetrate complete darkness, whereas a dwarf's can.</p><p>Special senses grant greater awareness that allows a creature with these senses to either ignore or reduce the effects of the undetected, hidden, or concealed conditions (described in Detecting Creatures below) when it comes to situations that foil average vision. The following are a few examples of common special senses.</p>\n<h2>Darkvision and Greater Darkvision</h2>\n<p>A creature with darkvision or greater darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness}</em> spell, block normal darkvision. A creature with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>\n<h2>Low-Light Vision</h2>\n<p>A creature with low-light vision can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so it ignores the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition due to dim light.</p>\n<h2>Scent</h2>\n<p>Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).</p><p>If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.</p>\n<h2>Tremorsense</h2>\n<p>Tremorsense allows a creature to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is usually an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the detecting creature is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>"

As noted in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Mount} specialty basic action, your mount needs to be at least one size larger than you and willing. Your mount acts on your initiative. You must use the Command an Animal action to get your mount to spend its actions. If you don't, the animal wastes its actions. If you have the Ride general feat, you succeed automatically when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} that's your mount.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are mounted on a horse and you make three attacks, your horse would remain stationary since you didn't command it.

For example, if you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VjxZFuUXrCU94MWR]{Strike} and then Command an Animal to have your mount Strike, your mount's attack takes a -5 multiple attack penalty.</p>\n<p>You occupy every square of your mount's space for the purpose of making your attacks. If you were Medium and on a Large mount, you could attack a creature on one side of your mount, then attack on the opposite side with your next action. If you have a longer reach, the distance depends partly on the size of your mount. On a Medium or smaller mount, use your normal reach. On a Large or Huge mount, you can attack any square adjacent to the mount if you have 5- or 10-foot reach, or any square within 10 feet of the mount (including diagonally) if you have 15-foot reach.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mounted Defenses</strong></h3>\n<p>When you're mounted, attackers can target either you or your mount. Anything that affects multiple creatures (such as an area) affects both of you as long as you're both in the area. You are in an attacker's reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you're mounted if the mount would be in the way.</p>\n<p>Because you can't move your body as freely while you're riding a mount, you take a -2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.</p>\n<h2>Aerial Combat</h2>\n<p>Many monsters can fly, and PCs can use spells and items to gain the ability to fly. Flying creatures have to use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.cS9nfDRGD83bNU1p]{Fly} action to move through the air. Performing an especially tricky maneuver\u2014such as trying to reverse course 180 degrees or fly through a narrow gap\u2014might require using Acrobatics to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Qf1ylAbdVi1rkc8M]{Maneuver in Flight}. Creatures might fall from the sky, using the falling rules. At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work in the air. For instance, a flying creature couldn't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}.</p>\n<h2>Aquatic Combat</h2>\n<p>Use these rules for battles in water or underwater:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're off-guard unless you have a swim Speed.</li>\n<li>You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.</li>\n<li>You take a -2 circumstance penalty to melee slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water.</li>\n<li>Ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage automatically miss if the attacker or target is underwater, and piercing ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.</li>\n<li>You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater.</li>\n<li>At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Drowning and Suffocation</strong></h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including casting spells with verbal components or activating items with command components) you lose all remaining air.</p>\n<p>When you run out of air, you fall unconscious and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:20] save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).</p>"

If your group wants to tell tales like those, you can use the stamina variant to help make that happen.</p><h2>Stamina Points</h2><p>Stamina Points represent a character's energy and readiness. They're reduced by damage just like Hit Points, but a character always loses their Stamina Points first, and loses Hit Points only if they're out of Stamina Points. If a character takes damage exceeding their remaining Stamina Points, the excess damage reduces their Hit Points. However, they lose any temporary Hit Points before losing Stamina Points.</p><p>Though Stamina Points and Hit Points function similarly when a character takes damage, a character recovers them differently. A <em>heal</em> spell restores Hit Points, not Stamina Points, and the actions described below (like Take a Breather) restore only Stamina Points, not Hit Points. A character regains all their Stamina Points after a full night's rest. Hit Points still determine whether a character remains conscious\u2014a character at 0 HP is unconscious, no matter how many Stamina Points they have. In addition to their ancestry Hit Points, a PC gains the number of Stamina Points and Hit Points indicated in the second and third columns of table above at 1st level. Both values increase by the same amount at each level thereafter. This replaces the Hit Points a character gains from their class in a standard game.</p><h2>Resolve Points</h2><p>In this variant, each PC also has a pool of Resolve Points, representing their intrinsic grit and luck. A character's maximum Resolve Points is equal to their key ability modifier, and a character regains all their Resolve Points with a full night's rest. In addition to spending Resolve Points to regain Stamina Points (as described under Stamina Actions), characters can spend Resolve Points in the following way.</p><h3>Stabilize</h3><p>If a character is dying at the start of their turn, their player can spend 1 Resolve Point to stabilize at 0 HP, gaining or increasing the wounded condition as normal for stabilizing. At the start of the character's next turn, they gain 1 HP and wake up (unless they started dying again). The character can act on that turn. Consider this an optional rule best suited for groups that have little access to healing. When using this rule, you might remove the ability for characters to use Hero Points to stabilize.</p><h2>Stamina Actions</h2><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qc0VsZ0UesnurUUB]{Take a Breather}</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xJEkXFJgEfEida27]{Rally}</li></ul><h2>Stamina Feats</h2><ul><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dUnT3HWMFD3d2eBJ]{Encouraging Words}</li><li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jFmdevE4nKevovzo]{Steel Your Resolve}</li></ul><h2>Other Creatures</h2><p>There's no need to give Stamina Points to monsters that are expected to be encountered once and likely defeated. However, you might use Stamina Points for a recurring character, especially an NPC who fights alongside the PCs. Usually, it's easiest to turn half the creature's Hit Points into Stamina Points. While enemy healers still work as they're intended to, players might be upset about the enemies' ability to heal their allies to full Hit Points, while the PCs are left not being able to heal their allies' Stamina Points. In this case, give more enemies Stamina Points to compensate.</p><h2>No-Limit Stamina</h2><p>If you want a fast-paced, almost superheroic game, you can skip the Resolve Point component of this subsystem and simply make Taking a Breather and Rally free. This gives the characters a lot of staying power, meaning that the group will typically keep adventuring until they run out of spells for the day, rather than having the additional pressure of running out of Resolve Points. If you use this approach, omit the Steel Your Resolve feat, as it's too powerful if there's no cost to use it! Alternatively, if you want to keep it, you can require a character to Take a Breather before they can Steel their Resolve again.</p><h2>Stamina's Impact</h2><p>The main gameplay consequence of using these stamina rules is that a quick 10- or 20-minute rest can restore most groups to full or nearly full health via Taking a Breather and Treating Wounds as necessary, allowing more encounters with shorter breaks in between. Additionally, charismatic or otherwise diplomatic characters gain fun and useful ways to bolster their allies.</p><p>Because spells that heal Hit Points don't restore Stamina Points, it's a little harder to heal up completely in the middle of a fight. This can mean that fights become deadly after characters have been beaten down, possibly causing retreats to be more frequent, but the retreats themselves are shorter. The focus of the game can stay consistently within encounters, with less managing of time and resources outside of battle.</p>"

Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. You can't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.UHpkTuCtyaPqiCAB]{Step} into difficult terrain.</p><p>Movement you make while you are jumping ignores the terrain you're jumping over. Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let you ignore difficult terrain on foot; such an ability also allows you to move through greater difficult terrain at the normal movement cost as for difficult terrain, though it wouldn't let you ignore greater difficult terrain unless the ability specifies otherwise.</p><h2>Hazardous Terrain</h2><p>Hazardous terrain damages you whenever you move through it. An acid pool and a pit of burning embers are both examples of hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.</p><h2>Narrow Surfaces</h2><p>A narrow surface is so precariously thin that you need to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (see Acrobatics) or risk falling. Even on a success, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} on a narrow surface.

The guidelines for assigning treasure are on page 508. You can dole out treasure in all kinds of ways. Treasure could be items carried by an adversary, rewards from a patron for completing a mission, or a classic pile of coins and items inside a wooden chest guarded by a monster. It's best to spread treasure throughout an adventure rather than stockpiled in a single hoard. This gives the players incremental rewards, letting their characters advance in frequent small steps rather than giant leaps separated by many hours of play.</p><h2>Treasure</h2><p>As the GM, it's your job to distribute treasure to the player characters. Treasure appears throughout an adventure, and the PCs obtain it by raiding treasure hoards, defeating foes who carry valuable items or currency, getting paid for successful quests, and any other way you can imagine.</p><p>This section provides guidelines for distributing treasure in a typical Pathfinder campaign, but you always have the freedom to assign extra treasure for a high-powered game, less treasure for a gritty survival horror adventure, or any amount in between.</p><h2>Treasure by Level</h2><p>Party Treasure by Level table on top of this page shows how much treasure you should give out over the course of a level for a group of four PCs. The Total Value column gives an approximate total value of all the treasure, in case you want to spend it like a budget. The next several columns provide suggestions for breaking down that total into permanent items, which the PCs keep and use for a long time; consumables, which are destroyed after being used once; and currency, which includes coins, gems, and other valuables primarily spent to acquire items or services. The final column gives the amount of currency to add for each PC beyond four in the group; use this only if you have more than four characters in the game.</p><p>For instance, between the time your PCs reach 3rd level and the time they reach 4th level, you should give them the treasure listed in the table for 3rd level, worth approximately 500 gp: two 4th-level permanent items, two 3rd-level permanent items, two 4th-level consumables, two 3rd-level consumables, two 2nd-level consumables, and 120 gp worth of currency.</p><p>When assigning 1st-level permanent items, your best options are armor, weapons, and other gear from Chapter 6 worth between 10 and 20 gp. The treasure listed in the row for 20th level represents a full level's worth of adventures, even though there is no way to reach 21st level.</p><p>Some creature entries in the Pathfinder Bestiary list treasure that can be gained by defeating an individual creature; this counts toward the treasure for any given level. Published adventures include a suitable amount of treasure throughout the adventure, though you should still monitor the party's capabilities as the PCs progress through the adventure to make sure they don't end up behind.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Currency</h3><p>A party will find money and other treasure that isn't useful on its own but that can be sold or spent on other things. The gp values in the Party Currency column don't refer only to coins. Gems, art objects, crafting materials (including precious materials), jewelry, and even items of much lower level than the party's level can all be more interesting than a pile of gold.</p><p>If you include a lower-level permanent item as part of a currency reward, count only half the item's Price toward the gp amount, assuming the party will sell the item or use it as crafting material. But lower-level consumables might still be useful, particularly scrolls, and if you think your party will use them, count those items at their full Price.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Other Types of Treasure</h3><p>Not all treasure has to be items or currency. Crafters can use the Crafting skill to turn raw materials directly into items instead of buying those items with coins. Knowledge can expand a character's abilities, and formulas make good treasure for item-crafting characters. A spellcaster might get access to new spells from an enemy's spellbook or an ancient scholar, while a monk might retrain techniques with rarer ones learned from a master on a remote mountaintop.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Treasure and Rarity</h3><p>Giving out uncommon and rare items and formulas can get players more interested in treasure. It's best to introduce uncommon items as a reward fairly regularly but rare items only occasionally. These rewards are especially compelling when the adventurers get the item by defeating or outsmarting an enemy who carries an item that fits their backstory or theme.</p><p>Uncommon and rare formulas make great treasure for a character who Crafts items. Note that if an uncommon or rare formula is broadly disseminated, it eventually becomes more common. This can take months or years, but the item might start showing up in shops all around the world.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Different Item Levels</h3><p>The levels listed for items on Table 10-9: Party Treasure by Level aren't set in stone. You can provide items of slightly higher or lower level as long as you take into account the value of the items you hand out. For instance, suppose you were considering giving a party of 11th-level PCs a <em>runestone</em> with a <em>fortification</em> rune (with a Price of 2,000 gp) as one of their 12th-level items, but you realize they've had trouble finding armor in their recent adventures, so you instead decide to give them a suit of 11th-level <em>+2 resilient armor</em> (1,400 gp) instead. Since the armor has a lower Price than the rune, you might also add a 9th-level <em>shadow</em> rune (650 gp) to make up the difference. The total isn't exactly the same, but that's all right.</p><p>However, if you wanted to place a 13th-level permanent item in a treasure hoard, you could remove two 11th-level permanent items to make a roughly equivalent exchange. When you make an exchange upward like this, be cautious: not only might you introduce an item with effects that are disruptive at the party's current level of play, but you also might give an amazing item to one PC while other characters don't gain any new items at all!</p><p>If you're playing in a long-term campaign, you can spread out the treasure over time. A major milestone can give extra treasure at one level, followed by a tougher dungeon with fewer new items at the next level. Check back occasionally to see whether each PC's treasure is comparable to the amount they'd get if they created a new character at their current level, as described under Treasure for New Characters below. They should be a bit higher. but if there's a significant discrepancy, adjust the adventure's upcoming treasure rewards accordingly.</p><h3 class=\"title\">Different Party Sizes</h3><p>If a party has more than four characters, add the following for each additional character:</p><ul><li>One permanent item of the party's level or 1 levelhigher</li><li>Two consumables, usually one of the party's level and one of 1 level higher</li><li>Currency equal to the value in the Currency per Additional PC column of Table 10-9</li></ul><p>If the party has fewer than four characters, you can subtract the same amount for each missing character, but since the game is inherently more challenging with a smaller group that can't cover all roles as efficiently, you might consider subtracting less treasure and allowing the extra gear help compensate for the smaller group size.</p><p><strong>Sidebar(s) </strong>@UUID[.f2wr86966A0oUUA0]{Adjusting Treasure}</p><h2 class=\"title\">Buying and Selling Items</h2><p>Characters can usually buy and sell items only during downtime. An item can typically be sold for only half its Price, though art objects, gems, and raw materials can be sold for their full Price.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Treasure (GMG Advice)</h2><p>The game's math is based on PCs looking to find, buy, or craft items that are the same level as them\u2014this includes weapons and armor with fundamental runes, and items that help with the PC's favorite skills or tactics. A PC who gets the item at that level will typically be ahead of the monsters, hazards, and skill DCs briefly, before their challenges start to catch back up. The guidelines for awarding treasure, meanwhile, have you give the party items 1 level higher than the PCs. This means the items found on adventures are more powerful than those a PC could make (which are capped at the PC's level). The treasure assignment is measured across a level instead of per encounter because some encounters won't have treasure, some will have extra treasure, and some treasure hoards or rewards might be found outside encounters entirely. If your campaign structure works better by giving out treasure for individual encounters\u2014such as some dungeon crawls or sandbox games\u2014see @UUID[.oBOw6E6V7ncrB1rN]{Treasure Per Encounter}.</p><p>As you choose treasure, look at the flow of treasure in the campaign, and see which PCs are ahead and which are behind. It's usually best to mix \u201ccore items,\u201d treasure linked to a PC's main abilities, with treasure that has unusual, less broadly applicable powers. For instance, a champion might not purchase <em>plate armor of the deep</em>, but they will likely wear it if they find it. These items should always be useful\u2014a party without a primal spellcaster won't have much use for an <em>animal staff</em>. The number of core items to give out depends partly on how much the campaign allows for crafting and buying items.</p><ul><li>If there are few limits on buying items and there's plenty of time to craft, make about half the permanent items you give out core items. The PCs have plenty of ways to obtain the items they want.</li><li>If purchasing items and obtaining formulas is somewhat difficult, make about three-fourths of the permanent items core items. If a PC really wants an item, they might have to do extra work to get it.</li><li>If there are no magic item shops or other ways to purchase items and formulas, make all the permanent items core items. In this case, it might work better for your game to use @UUID[.SnSGU7DPiogZ9JOr]{Automatic Bonus Progression} to eliminate the need for core items.</li></ul><h2 class=\"title\">Selling Items</h2><p>The PCs' ability to sell items plays a big part in their ability to equip themselves how they want. It's expected that a Pathfinder campaign strives for some amount of verisimilitude\u2014that PCs can't find a buyer for every item, especially if they're selling multiple copies of the same thing. Players should not have the expectation that they can sell whatever they want whenever they want. They might be unable to sell items that wouldn't be in demand, have to take a lower percentage, or have trouble selling items in places without massive wealth.</p><p>If you don't want to deal with that level of detail, you can choose to make selling items more abstract, allowing the PCs to sell anything for half Price essentially at any time. Since this makes it far easier for PCs to outfit themselves how they want, they might be more powerful.</p>"

This section explains how to build your own subsystems for tracking success via Victory Points. Many other subsystems throughout the chapter use these as well, though often by a different name.</p><p>Victory Points (or VP) are a powerful tool in your GM arsenal, as they allow you to track the PCs' progress using a subsystem to go beyond the results of a single check. Victory Points are versatile; you could track and resolve them within a single encounter, or you could collect them over the course of an entire campaign to determine the ending of the story.</p><blockquote><h3>Enemy Victory Points</h3><p>In addition to giving both the PCs and enemies Victory Points, as mentioned on page 149, sometimes it makes more sense to have only the enemies gain or lose Victory Points instead of the PCs. Even though the NPCs are also taking actions, it's usually best to increase or reduce the enemy's Victory Points based on just the PCs' actions, since it maximizes the feeling of player agency. In some rare cases where the foes act directly against the PCs, you might have both PC and foe actions increase the foe's Victory Points.</p><p>Implementing such a subsystem might mean flipping the normal rolls. For instance, if the PCs were trying to lower their enemies' Influence over a faction, a critical success by a PC would lower the Influence by 2, a success would lower the Influence by 1, and a critical failure might give the enemies something to exploit, raising their Influence by 1. This uses the same effects as an accumulating roll, but \u201cdamages\u201d the enemies' VP instead of gaining VP for the PCs' side. While this is very similar mechanically to the PCs gaining VP, the thematic connection is much stronger for an intrigue-based story.</p></blockquote><h2>Naming Your Victory Points</h2><p>It can be fun to rename your Victory Points, to better reflect the subsystem they track. The term \u201cVictory Points\u201d is unspecific, so you can create a name for your Victory Points that fits the theme of your adventure and helps the players feel more like they are taking part in the type of activity your subsystem represents. Examples of renamed VPs include Influence Points (page 151), Infiltration Points (page 160), Research Points (page 154), and Reputation Points (page 164). The name should be representative, and the PCs should understand what it refers to. You can leave off the word \u201cPoints\u201d if you prefer, though this section often retains it while describing how Victory Points can be used.</p><h2>Victory Point Subsystem Structure</h2><p>There are a few common structures for tracking Victory Points that you might use for your new subsystem. You could come up with a structure based off one of the subsystems below, or you could create your own completely different structure if none of them match the way you're running your game. The most important thing is to consider how the PCs or their opposition gain or lose various forms of Victory Points.</p><h3>Accumulating Victory Points</h3><p>The most common structure is to accumulate Victory Points toward a total, either stopping after reaching a success threshold or collecting as many Victory Points as possible in a given time frame and then measuring the results against various thresholds. The influence subsystem on page 151 is a great example of this structure in action: each PC has a certain number of chances to influence various NPCs, and after reaching a particular threshold of Victory Points with an NPC, the PCs have convinced that NPC.</p><p>In a variation of this structure, the PCs' adversaries can also accumulate Victory Points, giving the PCs a moving target\u2014either to reach the goal before the adversary or to have more Victory Points than the adversary at the end of a given time frame. This is a great structure for you to use in a situation where the PCs face opposition rather than having the PCs accumulate Victory Points while adversaries decrease the total, since it's dynamic and less at risk of resulting in a stalemate.</p><p>You can track a subsystem at a larger scale, like over the course of an adventure or campaign, by granting the PCs Victory Points for achieving difficult goals or making particular decisions. Such subsystems usually ask the PCs to compare their accumulated Victory Points against several ranked tiers that each having varying results on the story. Typically these results become more positive for the PCs as they acquire more Victory Points, but sometimes succeeding too fully could have unintended consequences, like convincing the workers to support a rebellion so thoroughly that it riles up a mob. If you're making your own subsystem, you might not define these ranks in full, but just use your best guess at the end.</p><h4>Accumulating Rolls</h4><p>In cases where the PCs need to make checks to gain Victory Points, the amount they get for the degrees of success is up to you. The default scale detailed below works in most cases.</p><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PCs gain 2 Victory Points.</p><p><strong>Success </strong>The PCs gain 1 Victory Point.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The PCs lose 1 Victory Point. This means that the result of a PC's check usually results in the party gaining either 1 or no Victory Points. However, specialized PCs have a solid chance of earning the party 2 Victory Points, and hare\u2011brained schemes have a fair chance of losing the PCs 1 Victory Point.</p><h3>Diminishing Victory Points</h3><p>Using this method, the PCs start with a certain number of Victory Points, and rather than accumulating them, they attempt to avoid losing them. Perhaps the PCs are trying to keep dragon eggs from cracking, or are otherwise attempting to minimize damage, loss, or danger. This variant is less common, but it's great at conveying the urgency of a situation as the PCs lose points. Sometimes it's necessary to add that sense of tension with this subsystem! Typically, when the PCs lose all their Victory Points, a negative event occurs. If they're on a timer, the final results might be better the more points they manage to keep before the time runs out.</p><h4>Diminishing Rolls</h4><p>Using this structure, the PCs typically lose Victory Points as a result of failed checks, though they can still lose them for making particularly poor decisions or behaving recklessly. Once again, you can use any scaling consequences that make sense, but the default degrees of success are as follows.</p><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> If regaining ground is possible, the PCs gain 1 Victory Point. Otherwise, as success.</p><p><strong>Success </strong>The PCs avoid losing any Victory Points.</p><p><strong>Failure </strong>The PCs lose 1 Victory Point.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure </strong>The PCs lose 2 Victory Points.</p><h3>Multiple Point Subsystems</h3><p>In a multiple point subsystem, you have more than one point system, each measuring something different. For example, in a long-distance race, the PCs and their opponents both try to gain their own Marathon Points, and whoever gets to 10 points first wins!</p><p>Infiltration on page 160 offers a different example of a Victory Point subsystem with multiple types of points. PCs try to get a certain number of Infiltration Points to successfully infiltrate a location while avoiding giving Awareness Points to their enemies through failure.</p><p>Consider combining the multiple points with a time factor, like in infiltrations, where the PCs automatically accrue Awareness Points over time at a slow rate.</p><h2>Obstacles and DCs</h2><p>When preparing your subsystem, think of the obstacles PCs might face or avenues they can exploit when engaging in your subsystem. Set some DCs for them in advance, using the normal system for setting DCs. Everything else, you can improvise on the spot. If you think your DCs will be higher overall, when you set the number of points needed, choose a value on the lower end (see Setting your Scale below).</p><p>Think of some possibilities that are much easier and some that are harder. Who are your PCs opposing, and what weak points might that opposition have that the PCs could exploit? Set those DCs lower or make overcoming them grant more VP. PCs who do their research or come up with clever strategies should find it easier to overcome the challenge.</p><h2>Setting Your Scale</h2><p>The number of points it takes to reach a goal will greatly affect how your subsystem feels during play. If you want the subsystem to be used for a single scene, such as one negotiation with a powerful NPC, set the number lower than if it's meant to take up most or all of a game session. The Table 3-1 (page 150) suggests possible values for your Victory Point scale. The \u201cadventure-wide\u201d scale is for subsystems that are part of a larger narrative, granting Victory Points when the PCs overcome entire encounters or dungeons, rather than as an encounter unfolds.</p><p>This larger scale is intended for subsystems that take a lot of the party's focus. A subsystem that runs in the background during an adventure should use a smaller scale. This is usually the \u201cadventure-wide, sideline\u201d value. It could be even lower, such as if you have a dungeon-based adventure including several opportunities to interact with a kobold tribe to get some small benefits. Though they appear throughout the adventure, you would use a lower value because attaining the VP is a minor part of the story. In fact, you might choose not to use a VP subsystem at all.</p><p>The table also lists numbers for one or more thresholds. These are the point values at which the PCs get a partial benefit (or, for a diminishing subsystem, take a drawback). You should grant partial benefits when the PCs reach a certain threshold or introduce twists to the subsystem to ensure they continue to feel engaged and rewarded over time.</p><table><caption><strong>Table: Victory Point Scales</strong></caption><tbody><tr><td><strong>Duration of Challenge</strong></td><td><strong>VP End Point</strong></td><td><strong>VP Thresholds</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Quick encounter</td><td>3-5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Long encounter</td><td>7-10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Most of a session</td><td>15-25</td><td>5, 10, 15</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure-wide, sideline</td><td>15-20</td><td>5, 10, 15</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure-wise, forefront</td><td>25-50</td><td>10, 20, 30, 40</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The values also depend on various factors. These might include the DCs, the number of chances the PCs get to gain Victory Points, and the flexibility of how the PCs can deploy themselves (for example, if PCs are all forced to try something they might not be trained in, it could cause critical failures). They might also include the amount of effort the PCs need to spend on tasks that don't directly earn Victory Points\u2014such as checks to Discover information about NPCs using the Influence subsystem. Keep all these in mind when deciding what end point you want to use.</p><h2>Running Your Subsystem</h2><p>When running your new subsystem, be sure to keep the challenges fresh by using a variety of different skills and options to encourage creativity and cooperation, rather than just using the same check over and over again, where PCs can expect diminishing returns. You can also use timers to encourage each PC to participate or even create mechanics that directly encourage each PC to participate, like setting penalties for the same PC attempting checks repeatedly, or for two PCs attempting the same check.</p><p>You can even have challenges that require all the PCs to participate. For instance, if the party's host is welcoming every guest individually, each PC might have to make an impression in their own way, or during infiltration, each PC might have to test their ability to Impersonate or Sneak. You'll likely find that some approaches should be automatic successes if they're well-suited to the task, or automatic failures for ideas that are likely impossible.</p><h2>Rewards</h2><p>How you structure rewards for your subsystem depends greatly on its scope. A subsystem resolved in a single sitting usually gives accomplishment XP unless it is particularly demanding, in which case it could be considered a full-scale encounter. Meanwhile, subsystems that span over the course of multiple sessions or the entire campaign might generate accomplishment XP at meaningful milestones along the way. If you have a long-spanning subsystem that's fairly low profile and behind the scenes or is not success-oriented, such as a subsystem to track what type of ruler the PCs' patron will become based on the PCs' decisions, you might not give XP directly from the subsystem, since in that case \u201csuccess\u201d is undefined.</p>"

                    "text": "<p>The artillerist's maxim holds that while fights might be won with swords, battles are won with cannons. Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p><p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><section class=\"info\"><h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4><p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p><p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been \u201cwon\u201d when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p><p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p><p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p></section><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.txWKzKuJus7UBebX]{Artillerist Dedication} Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p><hr /><p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7WBIXGqZbAKbqEU6]{Named Artillery} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p><hr /><p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart\u2014much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p><p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.IeRX0tGbeOF0ev08]{Shorthanded} Feat 4</h2><hr /><p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pph43ZrfvEnQjJXE]{Cannon Corner Shot} Feat 6</h2><hr /><p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.moXYfz806x6uXIW9]{Field Artillery} Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p><hr /><p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance\u2014a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ivSf8wSIUkK8gwej]{Live Ammunition} Feat 8</h2><hr /><p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example\u2014nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls\u2014but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.kVSZQvsz1cYjOwxL]{Master Siege Engineer} Feat 16</h2><hr /><p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew.

This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon.

For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them.

A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an atone ritual.

                    "text": "<p>The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p>\n<p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTINCT OF THE WYRM</strong></p>\n<p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.oo34CloLefFRi72w]{Dragon Disciple Dedication} Feat 2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

Like any form of magic, the discipline of eldritch archery will continue to develop among its practitioners across the multiverse.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.oyLkqhDGwGGj40ME]{Eldritch Archer Dedication} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in at least one type of bow</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You blend magic with your archery, leading to powerful results.</p>\n<p>If you don't already cast spells from spell slots, you learn to cast spontaneous spells and gain the Cast a Spell activity.

                    "text": "<p>You pacify restless spirits, ghosts, and haunts, capturing fragments of them and using their vengeful energies to fuel your own powers while purifying the spirit. You store these ghosts within a magical vessel called a spirit dwelling. This spirit dwelling might be a treasured family heirloom, an item you crafted expressly to help with exorcisms, or even just an odd trinket you found that happens to do the job.</p>\n<p>While the motivations of exorcists run the gamut, most are compassionate individuals who believe that every ghost, haunt, and spirit is simply a lost soul in need of rest. They collect spirits expressly for the purposes of offering them comfort, guidance, and absolution. After an exorcist's ministrations, these spirits are freed of their burdens, emotion, and regrets and are reabsorbed into the River of Souls. Although exorcists rarely gather in one place, many different religions employ them to deal with spiritual threats.</p>\n<p>Exorcists are most commonly found among the faithful of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.DJ7LDFTtns6YFodT]{Ashava} the True Spark (the empyreal lord of dancers), but among the major deities of the Inner Sea region, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.BNycwu3I21dTh4D9]{Sarenrae}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma}, and even @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.gxwmzxUWBOhdgFSN]{Shelyn} count a fair number of exorcists among their faithful. Exorcists can come from any walk of life, but many are redeemer champions, clerics, or monks. Apart from the role of the spirit dwelling, exorcism practices can vary. For example, a bard or rogue might attract spirits with trickery, charm, or empty promises. In contrast, a cleric of Pharasma could take a more severe route, demanding the spirits return to the natural order of things.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong> 8th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.HB0jvWCdim1p91q1]{Spiritual Sense}; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.y2XeMe1F18lIyo59]{Blind-Fight}; 14th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.EnpbhZr94ZyZI4hb]{Sense Evil}; 16th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.DM9rjXZrmx2MFX7k]{Sense The Unseen}</p>\n<section class=\"info\">SPIRIT DWELLINGS AND REMNANTS\n<p>A spirit dwelling can be any object, from an everyday item like a mirror, hand bell, or gemstone, to a custom clockwork device, so long as it can be held in one hand, is light Bulk, and doesn't serve another function (such as a weapon, shield, consumable, or magic item). Your spirit dwelling has the trait of the magical tradition used to take Exorcist Dedication and the necromancy trait. Your spirit dwelling is attuned to you, so only you can use it. If your spirit dwelling is lost or stolen, you can turn another object into a new spirit dwelling with a 1-hour ritual; this causes your previous spirit dwelling to revert to a mundane object and any spirits within to harmlessly disperse.</p>\n<p>Your spirit dwelling can house not just wisps but greater remnants of spiritual energy left behind by defeated ghosts and haunts. You can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.LWrR6UiGm3eCAALJ]{Collect Spirit Remnant} activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenating Spirits</strong>: Though all spirit wisps and most remnants can pass on immediately when purified, if a spirit remnant came from a creature with the rejuvenation special ability (such as most ghosts), a recurring haunt, or another entity who ordinarily doesn't pass on when destroyed, its ties to this world are too strong for it to easily pass on. When a spirit remnant from such an entity is released as part of your daily preparations, instead of joining the River of Souls, it begins re-forming itself in the time and location noted in its rejuvenation ability. However, you learn a clue about the spirit's unfinished business, which may help you put it to rest permanently.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">EXORCISTS ACROSS GOLARION\n<p>The well-known exorcists of Pharasma use methods of repeated prayer, holy water, and sacred rituals. Ashavic exorcists often dance under the moonlight to entice lost souls and guide them onward. In Osirion, exorcists practice execration, or proactive preventive exorcism techniques. In Northern Garund and some parts of Qadira, playing the stringed tanbura, rattling manjur, and specific drum patterns help cut the threads that tie the spirit to this world. Matanji orcs in the Mwangi Expanse perform exorcisms by drawing tattoo-like diagrams in iron ink. In Tian Xia, exorcists often use fulus (Secrets of Magic 158) to assist in their practice.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.TUIQBw9miDowhezw]{Exorcist Dedication} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Occultism or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to attract, quell, and purify spirits, housing them in a special receptacle called a spirit dwelling until they're ready to move on. Through the power of prayers or ritual incantations, one mundane object in your possession becomes a spirit dwelling (page 23). Your spirit dwelling functions as a lure for lost spirits weakened by their time on the Material Plane. Each day during your daily preparations, your spirit dwelling attracts a spirit wisp who comes to dwell inside. If your spirit dwelling contains no wisps, you can spend 10 minutes in a minor ritual to cast your spirit dwelling around an area and attract another wisp. You can also capture stronger spirit remnants from vanquished undead spirits, as explained in the sidebar on page 23. As long as your spirit dwelling contains any spirits, it glows faintly, casting dim light in a 10-foot radius.</p>\n<p>As an exorcist, you do more than just collect spirits: you also help rid them of their burdens and lingering resentments, aiding their transition from the Material Plane. Every day, before your daily preparations, any spirit wisps and remnants remaining within your spirit dwelling from the previous day are purified and can join the River of Souls in their final journey to Pharasma's Boneyard.</p>\n<p>You can also learn abilities that let you purify a spirit in your spirit dwelling immediately in a cathartic surge, granting you a helpful effect as they depart for the afterlife. Any actions you gain from the exorcist archetype gain either the divine or occult trait, depending on whether you used Occultism or Religion to qualify for Exorcist Dedication. <span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SPtzUNatWJvTK61y]{Spirit's Mercy} is the simplest of the purifications.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the exorcist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dVzPTpZoGSi5NR6y]{Cast Out} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Exorcist Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You attempt to cast a malevolent entity out of the creature or object it's possessing.

The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat.

You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.SAbzItAI4uwbdnQk]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, as described on page 218, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fyWKASX6uNByJF5]{Pass Through} feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can Leap, High Jump, Long Jump, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally\u2014you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks\u2014typically Athletics checks\u2014against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xUaEpnfd1FMGNG1z]{Frightful Moan} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> Once per 10 minutes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lament your fate, forcing each living creature in a 30-foot emanation to attempt a Will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected and temporarily immune to Frightful Moans for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is frightened 2.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pwM4RGwCTLiVSic0]{Ghostly Resistance} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghost Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your ghostly form becomes innately weaker but also gains resistance to many forms of damage.

A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.</p>\n<p>Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.</p>\n<p>Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies. These caste systems base their hierarchy on how much flesh one has consumed and can provide for other ghouls. Hunger and ambition drive ghouls to rise through the ranks, which allows them to feed their hunger even more.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: 6th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fO1vRDEfl9pysfLU]{Guarded Movement}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.VVsYBmVi2E1u9E5Z]{Reactive Pursuit}; 10th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7IsHNime3WneCan6]{Wall Run}</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:left\">@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.EHJRMCBRL4YeBN6l]{Ghoul Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You were killed by ghoul fever.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have succumbed to ghoul fever, dying and returning as a ghoul, an undead cursed with a never-ending hunger for dead flesh that slowly overrides your reason and willpower until you would do anything for the meal you crave. In addition to the personality changes, your body changes as well. Your ears become pointed, and your skin grows blueish and pale. Your fingernails sharpen into claws; your teeth become razor sharp, ready to tear flesh off the bone; and your tongue grows long and pointed.</p>\n<p>You gain the ghoul and undead traits and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.SAbzItAI4uwbdnQk]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is for the flesh of dead creatures; freshly dead corpses from sapient creatures fulfill your cravings much more than non-sapient or rotted corpses, but any dead creature can stave off the hunger for at least a little while. You gain two unarmed attacks in the brawling weapon group. The first unarmed attack is a claw that deals 1d4 slashing damage with the agile and finesse traits, and the second unarmed attack is a set of jaws that deal 1d6 piercing damage and have the finesse trait.</p>\n<p>You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1If9lLVoZdO8woVg]{Consume Flesh}. Satisfying your craving is difficult. Consuming Flesh temporarily satiates you. Many ghoul feats have extra abilities or functions that can be used when you are satiated, though using those abilities also causes you to lose your satiated status. You can always Consume Flesh, but eating more than a normal amount has no further effect; a ghoul's hunger is satiated, or it is not.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.NQtIhIowH1tVywZI]{Replenishing Consumption} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you devour corpses and satiate your hunger, you also recover from some of your wounds, your necrotized blue flesh knitting back together almost immediately as soon as you begin shoveling the chunks of dead flesh down your throat. Once every 10 minutes, when you Consume Flesh, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have, rounded up.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.VP2CWUTZ9Edg82uz]{Swift Leap} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> GhoulDedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent.

Strike with your claw or jaws. This attack deals negative damage instead of its normal type; on a hit, the target halves any healing it receives until the start of your next turn. The target or an adjacent ally can spend two Interact actions to squeeze the enzymes from the wound and remove the effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, when you hit you can choose to end your satiation and boost your enzymes, increasing the duration to 1 minute.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7GrACprIxZuarGDs]{Grave Strength} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The flesh you've consumed over the course of your existence as a ghoul has made you stronger, gifting you with strange insights from the minds of the sapient creatures you've devoured and bringing you closer to a state of undead perfection. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.YGk41WV42aTM7CQV]{Advanced Undead Benefits}. In addition, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed while you're satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8z9XkfZalQ5tUjfy]{Paralyzing Slash} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Feverish Enzymes</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your enzymes can paralyze your foes rather than merely making it harder for them to heal their wounds. Strike with your claw or jaws. If you hit a living non-elf creature, it becomes paralyzed unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Regardless of the result of the save, the creature is temporarily immune to Paralyzing Slash for 24 hours. A creature that becomes paralyzed can attempt a new save to end the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Aww98EQXcigRhY3v]{Sickening Bite} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is sickened 1. This is a disease effect.</p>\n<p>If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target sickened 1 on a regular hit instead.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.5GC2iGtVp3UAH2nm]{Glutton For Flesh} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you Consume Flesh while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have Grave Strength, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.U5hjS5qFrtGHWlVG]{Corpse Stench} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Ghoul Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10-foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be sickened (plus slowed 1 on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.</p>"

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p>\n<p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct positive energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">HALLOWED NECROMANCY IN GEB\n<p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion.

Once per day, when you use Drain Bonded Item, you can choose any spell in your spellbook that you can cast, even if you haven't prepared or cast it that day. Your soul cage doesn't need to be on your person for you to use Drain Bonded Item. If your soul cage is broken or destroyed, you can't use Drain Soul Cage.

You must decide which spell your gem contains when you take this feat; changing the spell requires retraining the feat. Once per day, you can drain the gem's magical energy to Cast the Spell without spending a spell slot. At 18th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 7th level. At 20th level, you can heighten whichever spell you chose to 8th level; regardless of which spell you chose, you can instead drain the gem's magical energy to cast an 8th-level spell turning without spending a spell slot.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.5JG0kjxukERBeayd]{Frightful Aura} Feat 18</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Lich Dedication, master in Intimidation</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You're surrounded by a palpable sense of menace and power that's terrifying to behold.

The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful dispel magic spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious. After a successful dispel magic spell or when you become conscious again, the hideaway immediately reforms with no additional action from you.

A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.t03Tc5I4B8RHsyqs]{Overwatch Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun.

The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PFMsj4LtdAIuGn4R]{Pistol Phenom Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

                    "text": "<p>Just as Golarion's merchants scour busy marketplaces for newfound goods, scholars of magic congregate in teahouses, debate at symposia, and haunt the back rooms of esoteric shops to swap secrets of their trade. In such meetings, a different kind of magic may strike: the spark of innovation! The mixing of magical techniques produces fascinating and unpredictable results. As one of these innovators, sometimes called a spell trickster, you have a knack for pioneering magical techniques and discovering new effects from spells most novice spellcasters take for granted. Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>The Fruits of Research</h4>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic\u2014but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing\u2014a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells; trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects. Whenever you gain a feat from this archetype, you either learn to modify the effects of a single spell, or you change one of the modifications from a previous feat.

When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Xjn4iYzJ6rLIpLV3]{Barrier Shield} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.TVKNbcgTee19PXZR]{Shield}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast shield, you can modify the spell to create a solid barrier you can use for cover, but not for blocking.

When you do, you summon a number of instruments equal to your spellcasting ability modifier that hover around you and play of their own accord. Once per turn when you Sustain the Spell, choose an opponent within 30 feet who can hear your performance. The target must attempt a Will save against the spell's DC; on a failure, it becomes distracted by your performance and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} for 1 round.

You and other creatures can attempt to Track the target, substituting an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the Survival check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.BQkqUrlUVNFp8BEq]{Wild Lights} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kl2q6JvBZwed4B6v]{Dancing Lights}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast dancing lights, you can modify its duration to be 1 minute and modify its standard effects to create a single floating light in the shape of a Tiny creature, instead of up to four floating lights. The creature hovers over your head unless you spend a single action that has the concentrate trait to direct the light to move up to 30 feet, in which case it remains there until you direct it again. If you direct it back to your head, it hovers there and follows you again until you direct it elsewhere.

Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. On a success, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes; on a critical success, it's also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} until it Escapes. The Escape DC is equal to your spell DC as long as the spell lasts. Once the spell ends, the Escape DC returns to the normal DC for a net (usually 16), and a creature adjacent to the target can Interact to remove the net.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.V3lFDAQr3PfnAxMC]{Confounding Image} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.j8vIoIEWElvpwkcI]{Mirror Image}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast mirror image, you can modify its duration to be sustained up to 1 minute and modify its range to 30 feet. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that appears in an unoccupied square within range. The image takes up space and has a reach of 5 feet, and your allies can flank with the image. It doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have other than an AC equal to your spell DC and saving throw modifiers equal to your spell DC - 10. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, or if you ever move more than 30 feet from it, the spell ends. Creatures can move through its space without hindrance.

The spell no longer ends if you ride atop the disk (though it does if any other creature rides atop it, including if the creature is riding on you). If you are riding the disk, it changes its capacity to hold you, plus additional Bulk equal to the maximum you could carry without being encumbered. If you ride atop the disk, you can direct it to move along the ground up to 30 feet or your Speed, whichever is slower, each time you Sustain the Spell. While you ride atop it, the disk can move over liquids as long as it ends its movement on solid ground. If it ends its movement on a surface that can't support it, the spell ends.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.6vpgAMj87J6cWN0j]{Drenching Mist} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication}, ability to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9XHmC2JgTUIQ1CCm]{Obscuring Mist}</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you cast obscuring mist, you can modify it to add the following heightened entry to its effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> Your mist is particularly laden with moisture.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers in the world at large. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shot white-hot blasts of energy. Wielders of star guns became bound together by the Star Code\u2014a set of cultural expectations that defined how one should behave while using these powerful weapons. You can find more information about star guns, the Crowned Regents, and the Star Code in Guns &amp; Gears.</p>\n<p>Most spellshots continue to come from Arcadia, as the stories describing the relevant skills and training to become one have been passed down over the generations. Many gunslingers who grow up in this region hear of these tales early in their lives, and they develop the techniques to channel magical energy through their firearms in imitation of the Regents' arcane methods. While Arcadia is home to the vast majority of the world's spellshots, the techniques have slowly spread to other regions.

You know how to maintain your dynamo and how to customize it to suit your needs and style, incorporating any promising new technologies you encounter into its design.</p>\n<p>There's a significant distinction, however, between someone who merely has a sterling dynamo prosthesis and someone like you who is a true sterling dynamo. With their recent invention, people in Absalom and Dongun Hold with access to the technology have begun to adopt sterling dynamos as their prostheses of choice, among the wide variety of amazing options already available in both markets. However, not everyone who chooses to use sterling dynamo technology is a member of the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<p>With the sterling dynamo archetype, you both use a sterling dynamo prosthesis and truly understand its advantages, limitations, and limitless potential. You don't have to literally be your own mechanic, as there's no requirement for a sterling dynamo to be particularly skilled at crafting, but even if you aren't, you can still \"feel\" what's right when it comes to adjusting and optimizing your dynamo. Whether you implement these improvements yourself or present your mechanic with ideas and insights that allow them to achieve something special on your behalf, your strength and ingenuity are what make you a sterling dynamo.</p>\n<p>As you train to use your dynamo in all sorts of adventures, you may become capable of feats its original inventors never dreamed possible. In fact, as you progress in the archetype and explore the possibilities, you might find that these inventors want to interview you in order to apply your insights and help them create a new generation of the technology with even greater capabilities. The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Prosthetics in Golarion</h4>\n<p>Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals @Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm]{Modular Dynamo} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dynamo has modular configurations, allowing you to swap between various different possibilities with ease in order to adapt to various situations in combat. Your dynamo attack gains the modular trait, as well as one of the following configurations of your choice: power driver (@Damage[1d6[bludgeoning]] damage; shove), percussive striker (@Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage; agile, finesse), rotating sickle (@Damage[1d6[slashing]] damage; trip), or entangling barbs (@Damage[1d6[piercing]] damage; grapple). If you have a manually controlled dynamo, these damage dice increase by 1 size, as usual, and you can also choose the extendable baton (@Damage[1d4[bludgeoning]] damage; finesse, reach), which has the damage increase already factored in.</p>\n<p>When you use an Interact action to switch configurations using the modular trait, you switch between the initial configuration of dynamo you chose with the Sterling Dynamo Dedication and the new configuration you chose with Modular Dynamo.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this feat multiple times.

If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the snarecrafter or trapsmith archetypes.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7Hx0i4VchvwrIOV5]{Gear Gnash} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}, expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Snares you create have complicated inner workings that are quite difficult to disable.

When you do, you recover the snare and can deploy it in another location.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.UJcQgQpZRqXBw0Nb]{Repurposed Parts} Feat 10</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are familiar with the fittings and cogwheels of your snares and can repurpose parts from prepared quick-deploy snares to assemble a new creation on the fly. Using two of the snares you prepared for quick deployment during daily preparations, you can quickly deploy a different snare that you know how to Craft, even if you didn't prepare that snare during your daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.k9B7gDit3pXbq2XF]{Finessed Features} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.uT9RnHLgIIcm7Hhs]{Trapsmith Dedication}</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned how to build snares that trigger based on visual stimuli. When you construct a snare using gears, you can cause it to trigger based on the visual features of a creature. For example, you could lay a snare that can only be triggered by a Large or Larger creatures, or one that only activates when a creature wearing red clothing would trigger it. You can use this ability to specify your snares to trigger on creatures that typically do not trigger snares, such as creatures smaller than Small, though the creature must still otherwise satisfy the snare's trigger as normal.</p>"

If you hit the second target, attempt to Strike a third target within 30 feet of the second target, and so on, continuing until you miss a target. You can cease the chain at any point; otherwise, it ends when you first miss an attack. However, you can't target the same creature more than once; each time you move to a new target, it must be a target you haven't made a Strike against yet during this particular use of Chain Reaction.</p>\n<p>This damage is caused by some improbable set of events that injures one target after another, rather than from actually making several shots. Perhaps you shot at a tree branch that then fell on the targets, or one target's scream caused another to accidentally set off their gun and shoot themselves in the foot. This means that only the first target suffers any special effects tied to the bullet (if it was magical ammunition, for example), but each target you hit still takes the same damage dealt by your Strike. Normally, all damage is of the same damage type as the initial bullet. However, the GM might choose to change the damage type based on their description of the chain reaction. For example, if one target was burned by fire, that target might take fire damage instead of physical damage.</p>"

                    "text": "<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have always felt that vehicles are as much works of art as they are means of transportation. It doesn't matter if it's as common as a chariot or as complex as an airship, there's always some aspect of the vehicle you can improve upon. Pilots, drivers, and sailors alike value your expertise, and many seek you out to work on their vehicles. While you can make a great profit working on custom vehicles for wealthy clients, you still keep a vehicle of your own to tinker with as your personal passion project.</p>\n<p>You might be part of a vehicle mechanic union, working with other mechanics and engineers to find fair jobs and support each other's labor. While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh\u2014the Whisper in Bronze\u2014the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously. While this might mean your character becomes obligated to help a fellow union member who needs your help, it also means you have steadfast allies you can fall back on in your own time of need. In dire straits, such a connection can be worth its weight in gold.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Unions</h4>\n<p>Vehicle mechanics typically ply their trade to those who need to keep their vehicles finely tuned. As in most other such trades, some vehicle mechanics form unions to keep business practices fair and to protect each other from predatory employers. The Absalom Shipwright's Union is the largest union for vehicle mechanics in Absalom, with over a thousand builders, carpenters, and engineers among its membership. Almenia Oarstone (LG female dwarf shipwright) is the current leader of the union, having been a member for more than 60 years. It is said that you can count on one hand the number of ships that have docked in Absalom on which she has never worked. The Shipwright's Union manages shipbuilding and repairs in both the Devil's Own and the Sea King Shipyard, and sometimes dispatches members to handle jobs that need doing at the Docks.</p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Using Vehicles</h4>\n<p>The vehicle mechanic plays best in a campaign where the PCs adventure together in one shared vehicle that the mechanic can enhance, such as in a pirate campaign on a single vessel. In this way, the vehicle mechanic archetype pairs excellently with a PC who has chosen the trick driver archetype. Vehicles are an element you should consider carefully before deciding to include, even in a guns and gears campaign. Vehicles are relatively complicated and can move very fast, which may make mapping encounters quite difficult. They can also move characters too far from the fight for other participants to respond. Think carefully before deciding whether to include the vehicle mechanic archetype, and make sure that vehicle use is right for your campaign's style and encounter area size.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fL5lO5Odp7iJPkan]{Vehicle Mechanic Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Intelligence 14, trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are adept at designing and maintaining mechanical vehicles, and you lavish your attention and ingenuity on one vehicle in particular.

Each time the pilot Drives your signature vehicle as a 2- or 3-action activity and succeeds at the Piloting check, the vehicle produces an additional effect, depending on its method of propulsion.

Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe.

Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity-a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p>\n<p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p>\n<p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Vigilante archetype.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K3Au5071pfvNwGob]{Hidden Magic} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear.

When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.vKzAIJuyr9SU2JzU]{Safe House} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.rNPeOwFZE5Ma18JJ]{Social Purview} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.qg8TlLJRgvjzW9YK]{Startling Appearance} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.

As long as what you say is true from the point of view of your current identity, you can say it even under effects like zone of truth that force you to speak the truth.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jZalt2bFGjK8XXcP]{Many Guises} Feat 8</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> master in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual-rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC. You can't use either social abilities or vigilante abilities while in this identity.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ano4tRq88V39eyPq]{Frightening Appearance} Feat 12</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Intimidation, Startling Appearance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your dramatic appearances can frighten bystanders.

Becoming a living mummy - one capable of both motion and thought - is another thing altogether.</p><p>Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.</p><p>The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others - usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists - upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p><p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by negative energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.</p><p>Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali.

You, however, somehow fell out of the flow of time, if only for an instant, but in doing so gained a perspective that few others have.<br /><br />Now you stand on the banks of the river, watching the flow, choosing where to dive in, or even defying the current, at least for a short while, as you skim its surface and skip from moment to moment. As a chronoskimmer, time is yours to exploit.</p><p>You have the means to see the timelines of all creatures, including your own. You can use this insight to manipulate the flow of time for creatures, much like you can pluck the leaf from the river and place it elsewhere.

When you roll initiative, you can choose one of three options: either do nothing and roll initiative normally, stabilize your timestream, or destabilize your timestream and send it into intense fluctuations. If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you don't roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10 + your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your timestream, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]. On a success, your initiative is equal to 19 + your initiative modifier, and on a failure, your initiative is equal to 1 + your initiative modifier. Both stabilizing and destabilizing your timestream are fortune effects.</p><p>Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with an opponent's initiative roll, you go first. Your manipulation of time grants you access to a number of abilities, some of which require a saving throw. The DC for these abilities is either your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, and is called your chronoskimmer DC.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the chronoskimmer archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.3aG0gkHulBIHqqGE]{Turn Back the Clock} Feat 4</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Chronoskimmer Dedication</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You fail a skill check or saving throw.</p><hr /><p>After failing a test of skill, you hop back in your personal timeline so you can try again.

If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a misfortune effect.

Those allies roll their initiative roll twice and take the better result; this is a fortune effect. You roll your initiative roll twice and take the worse result; this is a misfortune effect.

Some gain this power through magical training from an ancestor or mentor, while others earn it as a gift or reward from some greater being, or by inexplicable chance. Whatever the source, you have mastered the ability to form a mental image into a corporeal figment solid enough to affect the physical world. You trained the power to aid you in battle by shaping itself into a potent weapon, bound by only the reaches of your own imagination.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.juikoiIA0Jy8PboY]{Mind Smith Dedication} Feat 2</h2><p>You've learned to imagine a shape in your mind, to envision it so strongly it takes form in the material world. You gain a single melee weapon of your choosing, called a mind weapon. Your mind weapon is a martial melee weapon. The overall shape and design of your mind weapon can be of your choosing but it has one of the following four basic statistics:</p><ul><li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d4 damage and has the agile and finesse traits</li><li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d6 damage and has the finesse trait</li><li>A one-handed weapon that deals d8 damage</li><li>A two-handed weapon that deals 1d10 damage and has the reach trait</li></ul><p>Each day during your daily preparations, you can decide if you want your weapon to deal bludgeoning damage and be in the club weapon group, deal piercing damage and be in the spear weapon group, or deal slashing damage and be in the sword weapon group. Your mind weapon is an extension of your mind-it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back against the weapon's corporeal form and becoming mental damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken.</p><p>You can project your mind weapon using an Interact action, just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact action starting at the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a mind smith's keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can't be a magic item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon, and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other weapons or runestones for the usual cost. Any runes inscribed on the keepsake apply to your mind weapon when you create it. If your keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 week of downtime imprinting a new object with your weapon's mental properties, though this new keepsake won't have any of the runes that were inscribed on the prior keepsake.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the mind smith archetype.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.aMI39DZhWgNgJTAn]{Malleable Movement} Feat 2</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Mind Smith Dedication; expert in Athletics</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You Leap.</p><hr /><p>You shift the shape of your weapon to help you Leap farther and faster.

Choose two of the following weapon traits to give your mind weapon: grapple, modular (B, P, S), nonlethal, shove, or trip. Once chosen, these weapon traits can't be changed unless you spend 1 week retraining your fighting style to swap one property for another from the list.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xaSlCFYUXlu5f0zw]{Mind Shards} Feat 6</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Mind Smith Dedication</p><hr /><p>With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind.

Your ranged mind weapon Strike gains all the benefits of your mind weapon's runes as long as they still apply to a ranged weapon. For example, if your weapon had <em>+1</em>, <em>striking</em>, and <em>spell storing</em> runes, you would get a +1 item bonus to hit with your ranged mind weapon Strike, and it would deal the additional damage from the <em>striking</em> rune, but it wouldn't be able to unleash a spell from the <em>spell storing</em> rune, as that rune can be etched onto only melee weapons.</p><p></p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.2uQbQgz1AbjzcFSp]{Runic Mind Smithing} Feat 10</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Mind Smith Dedication</p><hr /><p>You focus your mind on thoughtforms of fundamental magical forces, shaping them into a property rune that you mentally etch onto your mind weapon. During your daily preparations, choose one rune from the following list of weapon property runes: <em>corrosive</em>, <em>disrupting</em>, <em>flaming</em>, <em>frost</em>, <em>shock</em>, and <em>thundering</em>. You enhance your weapon with the chosen rune until your next daily preparations. This rune counts toward your maximum limit of runes as normal.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8KUvJuAWCoxWg5FH]{Metallic Envisionment} Feat 12</h2><p><strong>Prerequisites </strong>Mind Smith Dedication</p><hr /><p>You always account for every weakness, allowing your mind to imagine just the right physical form to take advantage of your opponents.

In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you.

If you do something especially strange or dangerous while you're in your Daydream Trance, such as entering a restricted area or fighting someone in the street, any creature that isn't one of your allies must attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classOrSpellDC.value)] check against your class or spell DC (whichever is higher). On a success, it realizes something is amiss, and on a failure, it believes nothing is out of the ordinary. The creature can attempt a new check if you start doing something else strange, but not if you continue on the same course of action it already failed to notice was peculiar.</p><p>Any hostile action by you or your allies against an affected creature automatically ends the effect for that creature. The GM might allow the creature a new check if someone else brings your actions to its attention, such as if someone you're attacking calls out for help.

With other disciplines, the marks of experience accumulate as magic is learned, creating an equilibrium of sorts between the exercise of power and the necessary consequences. Time magic suffers no such limitations of cause and effect.

The threat of creating a paradox is ever looming. Many a reckless time mage has inadvertently erased themselves from existence, glimpsed a future they now have no choice but to enact, or attracted the attentions of temporal creatures, such as iriis or siktemporas.</p><p>For these reasons, most mages merely dabble in time magic, learning a spell or two here and there.

Unlike other Ilverani, also called \"snowcaster elves\" by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.</p><p>This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people.
