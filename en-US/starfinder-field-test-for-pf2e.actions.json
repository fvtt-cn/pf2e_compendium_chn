For burst, you can position the center point anywhere within your first range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a @Check[type:reflex|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don't roll an attack roll).

Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a move action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>"
