			"name": "Angel Eidolon",
			"description": "<p>Your eidolon is a celestial messenger, a member of the angelic host with a unique link to you, allowing them to carry a special message to the mortal world at your side. Most angel eidolons are roughly humanoid in form, with feathered wings, glowing eyes, halos, or similar angelic features. However, some take the form of smaller angelic servitors like the winged helmet cassisian angel instead. The two of you are destined for an important role in the plans of the celestial realms. Though a true angel, your angel eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the angelic messenger ritual, even if they somehow learn it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> divine</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> angel, celestial, eidolon</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> must be good, usually neutral good</p>\n<p><strong>Home Plane</strong> Nirvana (if NG), Elysium (if CG), or Heaven (if LG)</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Attacks</strong> fist (bludgeoning), wing (bludgeoning), unarmed attacks shaped like a weapon</p>\n<p><strong>Angelic Avenger</strong> Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 10; +2 AC (+3 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Angelic Emissary</strong> Str 12, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14; +1 AC (+4 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> Diplomacy, Religion</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> Celestial</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Eidolon Abilities</strong> Initial hallowed strikes; Symbiosis traveler's aura; Transcendence angelic mercy</p>"

Most phantom eidolons are humanoids with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms. Your link with your eidolon prevents it from succumbing to corruption and undeath.

			"name": "Beast Eidolon",
			"description": "<p>Your eidolon is a manifestation of the life force of nature in the form of a powerful magical beast that often has animal features, possibly even several from different species. You might have learned the way to connect with the world's life force via a specific philosophy or practice, such as the beliefs of the god callers of Sarkoris, or formed a bond on your own.

		"Construct Eidolon": {
			"name": "Construct Eidolon",
			"description": "<p>Your eidolon is a mental construct based on an astral thoughtform and given physical presence and life by its connection to you, its shape limited only by your imagination. Your eidolon's appearance and physical form vary based on your shared vision for its construction, from clockworks to stuffed dolls and everything between, and it's not uncommon for that appearance to change greatly as your construct gains evolutions. Because it arises from an astral entity, your construct is no mindless servitor, but a fully thinking being with its own ideas, goals, and even emotions. These entities are extremely diverse; while many construct eidolons come from a powerful symbiotic connection with astral denizens, just as many arise from the forgotten memories of ancient empires and craftworks drifting across the Silver Sea of the Astral Plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> astral, construct, eidolon</p>\n<p><strong>Home Plane</strong> Astral Plane</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Attacks</strong> fist (bludgeoning)</p>\n<p><strong>Warrior Construct</strong> Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 8; +2 AC (+3 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Scout Construct</strong> Str 14, Dex 18, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 8; +1 AC (+4 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> Arcana, Crafting</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> one common mortal language</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Eidolon Abilities</strong> Initial construct heart; Symbiosis reconfigured evolution; Transcendence ultimate reconfiguration</p>"

			"description": "<p>Your eidolon is a demon, born of mortal sin congealed amid the chaos and evil of the Abyss, using its link to you to spread chaos at your side. Choose an associated sin for your demon. Demon eidolons have appearances as varied as the infinite Abyss. While demons are inherently untrustworthy, your demon eidolon has reached an accord with you and generally keeps it, though that doesn't mean your eidolon isn't actively working to bring your life deeper into its associated sin. Though a true demon, your demon eidolon's link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the abyssal pact ritual, even if they somehow learn it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tradition</strong> divine</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> demon, eidolon, fiend</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong> must be chaotic evil</p>\n<p><strong>Home Plane</strong> The Abyss</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Attacks</strong> claw (slashing), jaws (piercing), horn (piercing), tail (bludgeoning), tentacle (bludgeoning), wing (bludgeoning)</p>\n<p><strong>Wrecker Demon</strong> Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 12; +2 AC (+3 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Tempter Demon</strong> Str 12, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 16; +1 AC (+4 Dex cap)</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong> Intimidation, Religion</p>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> Abyssal</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Eidolon Abilities</strong> Initial demonic strikes; Symbiosis visions of sin; Transcendence blasphemous decree</p>"

			"name": "Dragon Eidolon",
			"description": "<p>Because dragons have a strong connection to magic, their minds can often leave an echo floating in the Astral Plane. Such an entity is extremely powerful but unable to interact with the outside world on its own. Dragon eidolons manifest in the powerful, scaled forms they had in life; most take the form of true dragons (albeit smaller), but some manifest as drakes or other draconic beings.

Many fey appear similar to mortal humanoids with unusual features such as pointed ears, wings, or bodies composed of natural elements, but the full variety of fey is endless, and many others appear completely inhuman. Fey from the First World never truly die, instead forming a new creature. Fey eidolons usually come about when a summoner helps stabilize a difficult reformation. This means your fey eidolon likely lived a different life just before meeting you and might remember fragments of its old memories.

Their ultimate form can be influenced by an amalgamation of the echoes and memories of their old life before becoming undead, their cause of death, their encounters in the afterlife, and portions of your own essences.
