            "description": "<p>While most ghosts are bound to the site where they died or were buried, some instead find themselves bound to specific items, such as a particular piece of jewelry, article of clothing, pet's collar, or a stone from a building in which it dwelled. These items, known as anchors, were important to the ghost in life, or critical to the events of their death and haunting.</p>\n<p>A creature with anchored incorporeality has the incorporeal trait, meaning it can move through physical creatures and such creatures can move through it. It can't attempt Strength‑based checks (such as @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Grapple]{Grapple}) against corporeal creatures and corporeal creatures can't attempt such checks against it. Though incorporeal, a creature with anchored incorporeality can travel no more than 60 feet from its anchor and must maintain line of effect to the anchor. This typically prevents it from moving through walls. Unlike many other incorporeal creatures, a creature with anchored incorporeality doesn't have resistance to all damage or immunity to precision damage.</p>\n<p>A character with an animal companion or familiar that has anchored incorporeality can transfer the anchor to a new item with a special ritual. This requires spending 1 week in concert with the companion to create a new anchor. A character who knows this technique might be able to adapt it to transfer a ghost's Site Bound ability (or similar restriction) to tie it to an anchor instead of a place.</p>"

The only skills in which a mindless companion is trained are Acrobatics and Athletics, and it can't become trained in other skills. Even if a mindless companion gains a limited ability to act in combat without being commanded, such as from the Mature Animal Companion feat, it can repeat only the last command; it can't take a new action on its own. A mindless companion can't take specializations that would raise its Intelligence or grant it benefits to skills other than Acrobatics or Athletics, and it can't use or benefit from feats or other options for animal companions that normally require a creature to have a mind, think, or make a decision. When in doubt, the GM determines what abilities a mindless companion can use.</p>"
