Consumed by self-loathing for the lives they squandered to false faiths and empty creeds, these lost souls serve as terrifying and implacable-yet ultimately pathetic-foes. A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.</p>\n<p>Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god-a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimaviggas.</p>"

Some of these megalomaniacal beings are tyrants, creating illusory kingdoms populated by abducted creatures forced to validate the creator's views. A more altruistic adachros might seek out pupils to reeducate and advise-though often without their consent-while always pushing their students to accept whatever unique philosophy was involved in their creation. An adachros might abandon disciples who spurn them, but more often, they become a bitter enemy, intent on destroying the perceived heretics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Astral Plane is a planar nexus, connecting the planes of the Inner Sphere to those of the Outer Sphere, a realm of timeless silver substance charged with mental essence drawn from throughout the Great Beyond. Most creatures on the Astral Plane are visitors-predators seeking to poach from the River of Souls, psychopomps guarding against such incursions, and aeons monitoring the flow of raw quintessence through the Antipode. Yet, this plane has spawned creatures native to its strange currents and eddies, foremost of which is the family of thought-spawned creatures known as ennosites.</p>\n<p>An ennosite's form physically embodies of its thought and purpose.

An adhukait's two heads, two hearts, and two minds rarely work as one-except to maim or kill.</p>\n<p>Even adhukaits' origin contains not one but two stories. Some believe they were created when two godlike brigands attempted to raid a celestial hall and had their bodies crushed together and thrown down from the heavens. Another legend states two asura twins once challenged a great warrior to duel them in turn. When they attacked him together, he was so enraged he slammed one into the other so hard that they were fused together from that day forth.</p>\n<p>Adhukaits are among the most elite asura warriors, making up for what they lack in spellcraft with sheer viciousness and single-minded pursuit of inflicting pain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible.

As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build.</p>"

At first glance, these isolated people look much like their Erutaki human cousins; they typically have terra-cotta skin, straight black hair, and compact, powerful builds. However, adlets tend to be taller and more sinewy than their human kin. Up close, adlets' strangeness reveals itself-each sports a maw full of wolflike teeth. Their legs and tail resemble that of a dog.</p>\n<p>Adlets' legends say that long ago, a mighty hunter lost his way far from home and came upon a house of whalebone and ice. A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, five of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other five-born with the legs and tails of wolves-traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the first adlets.</p>\n<p>Adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex. Still, while adlet raids are a common problem for travelers in the Crown of the World, a handful of wily and intrepid merchants have forged peaceful relations with certain adlet communities along more common routes.</p>"

			"publicNotes": "<p>An amphisbaena is an exceedingly aggressive, venomous viper of remarkable size that bears two heads-one on each end of its body. It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p>\n<p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p>\n<p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p>\n<p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.</p>"

Muscles and tendons lash the ship together, tightening and loosening to precisely turn the ship as it sails.</p>\n<p>When a bone ship encounters another vessel or finds some other opportunity to sow death, smaller corpses strewn throughout the ship animate to form a crew and boarding party. Each crew member resembles a humanoid skeleton, but they might be made of bones from multiple creatures.

The small black gemstones stippled across the ship's structure hold the souls of a drowned crew, for a bone ship is the cursed legacy of dead sailors.</p>\n<p>When mass death happens at sea-often from an entire ship sinking far from shore-the anguish of the dying victims can spawn a bone ship. This event might occur when a sailor makes a final plea to a dark god or when a deity takes the opportunity to bind many dead sailors' souls together as a destructive show of divine power. When not created through divine intervention, a bone ship can grow slowly and organically from one of the ships piloted by the undead sailors known as @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.48agy7vl9fQW1LLA]{Draugr}.

These vessels look different from many other bone ships with patchwork or asymmetrical appearances.</p>\n<p>A bone ship is almost gluttonous, possessing an unceasing appetite for death, destruction, and new souls to add to its number. These desires stem from an underlying cause, either placed within the ship by its creator or accreted from the scattered final wishes of its component dead souls. For example, a deity might send a bone ship on a special mission to carry a message or dispose of a particularly persistent adversary or annoyance. Though bone ships usually travel upon the waves, they have no need to breathe and can carry out underwater missions at the behest of their creator.</p>\n<p>Bone ships hold a legendary reputation among sailors.

			"publicNotes": "<p>A coral capuchin resembles a hairless pink monkey with large eyes and batlike wings. Something of a tropical nuisance, these amphibious creatures follow trade ships, hoping to filch small valuables they can take home or perhaps find a sailor they can befriend to secure a regular supply of food.</p>\n<p>Coral capuchins live in tropical climates, and while they can breathe water or air with equal ease, their membranous skin means they rely heavily on having a nearby source of water. Fresh- and saltwater serve equally well for this purpose, though the creatures generally congregate near oceans and seas for other reasons. Jungles, islands, and warm coastlines are their most common nesting sites, though they usually hide their nests high in trees or in other locations out of easy reach of predators, scavengers, or anything that might steal the trinkets they've collected.</p>\n<p>These little flyers are insatiably curious, and they love to follow humanoids around. Capuchins largely agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training, learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats and other pests on a ship. Some spellcasters residing along tropical coastlines have taken coral capuchins as familiars, though many claim the critters as far more trouble than any benefits they provide are worth. A capuchin familiar might pilfer spellcasting components, gemstones, vials, crafting materials, and other trinkets from their master, though a clever magic user will intersperse more appealing (and less valuable) baubles to draw their familiar's attention away from actually important items.</p>\n<p>Capuchin clans live together under a single matriarch, a slightly larger female who can be identified by her unusually prismatic skin and colorful eyes. These females refuse to be tamed or kept as pets and violently resist all forms of capture. The most powerful among them even possess divine powers which they call upon to protect their homes and kin. In return, the remainder of the clan fights fiercely to protect their matriarch, defending her (and her trinkets) from threats far larger than themselves.</p>"

Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need-usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a lizardfolk village in a remote swamp.</p>\n<p>Some crossroads guardians are martial beings-defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example-but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed.

The galvo can even disperse into a swarm of eels, though it usually does so only to travel through narrow spaces or otherwise accomplish things it's incapable of in its normal form.</p>\n<p>These component eels share some element of a collective consciousness, giving the galvo more intelligence than a typical animal. Individual galvos generally don't have any need for or interest in socializing, though they sometimes gather to collaborate while hunting.</p>\n<p>Electricity arcs throughout a galvo, and the more the eels that make it up move about, the larger and more impressive the electric display. This electricity creates a damaging field around the galvo that causes small fish and other sea life to drop dead. Many galvos contentedly snack on these prey. Even beyond the harmful field, underwater creatures feel a faint unease from galvos, and might notice how ferrous trinkets and sediment slowly drift toward them.</p>\n<p>A galvo attack could come from a lone creature or a small group. In addition to dangers of the electricity field generated by galvos' eels, galvos might attack by biting with their eels' maws or even firing off one of their eels like a dart, striking a distant target with a living, electrified projectile.</p>"

Though most comfortable on the forest floor, a porcupine can climb trees adeptly to seek out leaves, bark, and insects for food. The giant porcupine is no less shy than its smaller kin, but these 5-foot-long specimens climb only the ancient old growth of deep forests. Both species are found only in temperate woodlands, though a giant porcupine prefers forests with less undergrowth where it can maneuver more easily. When startled or threatened, a porcupine employs multiple strategies to discourage potential predators. It emits a pungent odor that warns other creatures away, rattling its quills and chattering its teeth loudly to provide an additional auditory warning. If cornered, it raises its quills, faces away from the danger, and charges backwards at full speed, impaling any unlucky creatures is in its path.</p>\n<p>A porcupine's barbed quills-in actuality long, stiff hairs-hook into a foe's flesh. A creature can easily pull free from the porcupine should a creature come into contact with one, but the quill's barbed tips continue to dig into the victim's skin from the creature's own movements. Removing the quills is a painful process, and quills that break off under the skin can sometimes requires a healer's assistance to remove effectively. Contrary to popular belief, however, a porcupine can't shoot its quills, making it a threat only to a creature brazen or foolish enough to attack it directly.</p>\n<p>Porcupines use the same defensive tactics regardless of size, but the giant porcupine is often devastatingly effective given its sheer mass. Fortunately, these creatures tend to flee at the first opportunity to do so.

Merfolk and other underwater cultures often use them as pack animals, while some coastal cultures ride them as mounts. Earning a seahorse's trust can be rather difficult given their skittish nature, but giant seahorses can express incredible loyalty and affection once they bond with someone, even going so far as to risk their own well-beings to defend someone who has earned their trust. They don't take to combat naturally, though, and in dangerous situations, they're more likely to try and grab their rider with their strong, prehensile tails before swimming to safety, rather than staying in a fight. Like smaller seahorses, giant seahorses have bony armor plates on the outside of their bodies, covered by skin, which makes them fairly durable despite their reluctance to battle.</p>\n<p>Though not the strongest swimmers, seahorses rely primarily on natural camouflage to survive. Chromatophores in seahorses' skin allow them to camouflage themselves. This ability is fairly rudimentary, and the size of a giant seahorse makes this tactic far less effective for them than for their smaller kin. Their colors change slowly at most times, though when in a dangerous situation, the process occurs much more rapidly for the seahorse.</p>\n<p>Unlike regular seahorses, giant seahorses also rely on herd tactics for defense as well as their surprising physical strength. A herd of charging seahorses is just as terrifying and dangerous underwater as a herd of stampeding horses on land. Humanoids in underwater cultures learn at a young age to quickly get out of the way of a herd of stampeding seahorses.</p>\n<p>Baby giant seahorses are too big to easily float and lack sufficient strength to swim on their own for several weeks after birth. They instead link tails with an adult and allow themselves to be ferried around. An adult seahorse can carry upwards of 20 seahorse babies hanging from them at once, though these babies might occasionally get left behind or swept away by a strong current.

Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock.</p>\n<p>Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets.</p>\n<p>While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode. While this belief isn't strictly true, vultures do have several unique adaptations to avoid common diseases that would take out predators or even other scavengers. Due to their size, giant vulture talons in particular are sometimes used to craft weapons in regions where other resources are scarce.</p>"

Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted.

Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving an uncomfortable vacuum with their unexpected exodus.

By contrast, strix face an ageless conflict with the human populations that surround their home at Devil's Perch, forced to fiercely defend their ancestral territories against human incursion.

Strix communities debate whether this curse still haunts their people. Those that believe so cite the endless bloody conflict between the strix tribes and the nearby humans, who regard the strix as winged devils to be purged from their territories. Due to strix's deep emotional connection to each member of their tribe, any strix life taken by human hands leads to swift retaliation, which humans use to paint strix as monsters. This cycle of retribution, along with continuous loss of strix land, has bred generations of hatred.</p>"

Drawn to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, vishkanyas often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin.

The ancestors of modern day wayangs set out on a great exodus some 10,000 years ago, leaving their native Shadow Plane to seek out a new home. On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home. When the light returned, wayangs retreated into what shadowy places they could find, avoiding contact with humans and other peoples of the light, who viewed the small, gaunt beings as suspicious reminders of difficult times.</p>\n<p>Many wayang groups are nomadic, though many other groups have sedentary communities. Some live in homes carved out of natural caves, where they create works of art from stalagmites and other natural features.

			"name": "Yzobu",
			"publicNotes": "<p>Yzobus are herd beasts common across northern plains and mountains, resembling a cross between a steer, a sturdy horse, and a yak. They most notably feature a pungent stench caused by bodily secretions building up within their thick, shaggy pelts-a stench so strong that yzobu herds can often be smelled before they appear. Territorial and aggressive, yzobus often attack other creatures on sight. When threatened, a herd launches into a stampede, trampling any in their path and goring survivors with their distinctive horns.</p>\n<p>Some ranchers trade yzobu hides as a workable leather for mercenaries and guards, but the powerful smell means that most ranchers tend their small herds on the outskirts of towns. Typically, yzobus aren't raised to a specific age, but rather are killed whenever one escapes and poses a threat. The hides require an intensive tanning process with almost constant brushing and hours soaking in salt water-but the effort results in a leather both soft to the touch and sturdy enough to work as an effective armor for several years.</p>\n<p>Hides aren't the only yzobu products worth harvesting. A female yzobu's milk is rich and nutrient-rich, making it a staple food source in some regions. Their meat is less enticing but still edible.</p>\n<p>These beasts remain a permanent part of hobgoblin society, where their aggressive temperaments and durable, sturdy bodies are great assets. Hobgoblins possess an immunity to yzobu stench, and they view the fact that other races sickened by it as further evidence of their own superiority. They also highly prize yzobu mounts, and hobgoblin commanders often paint their yzobu's horns in varying colors and patterns to show how many enemies the mount has killed. Yzobu cavalry are a staple of hobgoblin military action, and they played a key role in the recent Ironfang Invasion that led to the formation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak in Avistan. The establishment of Oprak meant that many Avistani who had never encountered yzobus before have grown familiar-if not enchanted-with their distinctive odor.</p>"

		"Zetogeki": {
			"name": "Zetogeki",
			"publicNotes": "<p>Basalt comprises the earthen bodies of zetogekis, giant lizards with an innate ability to absorb and redirect kinetic energy. They dwell near active volcanos, particularly at hot springs and geysers, from which they drink copious quantities of steaming, mineral-rich water. Since they have no need for any other sustenance (and in fact can't digest anything else), zetogekis guard these watering holes. The worst fate that can befall the proprietor of a mountain hot spring is the arrival of a zetogeki, which can transform a lucrative business into a public hazard overnight. Mountain dwellers who make use of such hot springs pay monster hunters handsomely to eradicate or chase off zetogekis, but dealing with the stubborn beasts is no mean feat.</p>\n<p>Even in wilder lands, zetogekis prove menacing to mountaineers. The lizards sometimes purposefully throw themselves down mountainsides to absorb the kinetic energy dealt to them during their tumble. They use this accumulated energy to take down predators-though zetogekis see nearly every other type of creature as a predator.</p>\n<p>This marvelous ability to absorb and dole out physical energy come from a zetogeki's unique configuration of shale-like scales, which it can angle at will much like a porcupine extending its quills. Those who encounter a zetogeki hunkered down with its scales in the telltale raised pattern of zig-zagging black and gold would do well to give the lizard a wide berth. This danger has its upsides, however; some alchemists and wizards offer substantial bounties for intact zetogeki hides.</p>"

They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect-their \"wards\"-and are ancient enemies of the oni. Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but the spirits fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat. Kami choose their own wards, though many mortals seek to attract them to sites that might require protection, leading to a proliferation of certain trees, statues, gates, and other symbolic elements in areas where kami are known to dwell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Zuishin are kami warriors and archers who task themselves with watching over important shrines, ancient gates, or sacred doorways. Monasteries secreted away in snowy valleys, pagodas hidden in remote forests, and archways that mark the passage into sacred hidden cities all might host such kami. With sturdy armor and hallowed armaments, zuishin fight tirelessly to drive off any evil powers who wish to desecrate their wards. Of all kami, zuishin most frequently fight against oni, as the wards zuishin guard are most often targeted for desecration by these vile fiends.</p>\n<p>Most zuishin wear ancient armor and wield powerful weapons like swords and bows, but some might use spears, axes, or only their fists, depending on their ward and the people who make offerings there. Zuishin tend to regard mortals with skepticism. To earn a zuishin's trust, a supplicant might offer items of natural significance, such as an urn of hallowed earth, a branch from an ancient tree, or an arrangement of local flowers.</p>\n<p>Like all kami, a zuishin might come across as reserved or even indifferent to humans and their ilk; however, this impression stems only from a zuishin's wisdom and longevity, which makes mortal affairs seem relatively trivial. In the company of other kami, however, they're unerringly benevolent and readily offer their aid to their fellows. For example, a zuishin whose ward lies nestled in an ancient forest might readily join forces with kodama in those trees to deter foes.</p>"
