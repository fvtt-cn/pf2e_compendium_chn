		"Artillerist": {
			"name": "Artillerist",
			"description": "<h1>Artillerist</h1>\n<p>The artillerist's maxim holds that while fights might be won with swords, battles are won with cannons. Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale. You're a consummate professional in the art of big guns, a maestro at merging mathematics and manpower to transform whatever castle wall, infantry battalion, or rampaging dragon offends you into a smoking crater in the ground.</p>\n<p>You're not just some daredevil demolitionist, though. You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Leading with a Cannon</h4>\n<p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p>\n<p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been “won” when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p>\n<p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p>\n<p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.txWKzKuJus7UBebX]{Artillerist Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members. At best, a mistake might just waste time. At worst, a misaligned fuse or a badly set pin could cause the whole thing to explode. You've taken these lessons to heart, and so your presence on an artillery team assists the entire team at every aspect of the siege weapon's deployment and usage. If you're serving on a siege weapon crew, you and all other members gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any checks to Load, Aim, move, or Repair the weapon. When you Aim a siege weapon, you can move the weapon's aim twice as far as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the artillerist archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7WBIXGqZbAKbqEU6]{Named Artillery} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is a tradition among artillerists to name the siege weapon most important to them and closest to their heart—much as a sailor on a ship, the weapon is their livelihood. You've gone a step further, and you always make sure that your named artillery has the best possible maintenance and upkeep. You can spend a full day adjusting and working on a single siege weapon to designate it as your named artillery. The siege weapon you designated as your named artillery gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves as well as additional Hit Points equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p>During your daily preparations, you must spend at least one hour on maintenance to service your named artillery. If you fail to do so, or if you spend a full day designating a new piece of named artillery, the previous named artillery loses any benefits from this feat. Only one artillerist can designate a particular siege weapon as their named artillery, even if several artillerists are serving on the same siege weapon's crew (though it's typically more efficient for a group with several artillerists to divide them up, assigning one to each siege weapon).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.IeRX0tGbeOF0ev08]{Shorthanded} Feat 4</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>Typically, a siege weapon is meant to be run by a crew with a very specific minimum number of members designed to ensure that your crew can account for every possible variable and necessity in loading, aiming, and firing the weapon. In a pinch, however, you can operate it with fewer people, provided you know what you're doing. You can operate a siege weapon with fewer than the minimum number of crew, at an increasing penalty. You and your crew take a -2 penalty to checks to Load, Aim, Launch, move, or Repair the weapon for each person below the minimum crew. The maximum number of missing minimum crew members you can handle with this feat is 5. For example, if a siege weapon had a minimum crew size of 8, you would still need a crew of 3, and you would take a -10 penalty when doing so.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pph43ZrfvEnQjJXE]{Cannon Corner Shot} Feat 6</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>By loading special ammunition in a particular way, you can make your siege weapons do all manner of tricks that other siege engineers can barely even imagine. If you personally contribute an additional Load action to the siege weapon's loading, above the minimum, you can change a burst into a line twice as long as the size of the burst, or vice versa (so a 10-foot burst turns into a 20-foot line, or a 20-foot line turns into a 10-foot burst).</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.moXYfz806x6uXIW9]{Field Artillery} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While castles are generally obliging enough to stay in one place, out in the field positioning is of paramount importance—a gun in the wrong place is worse than useless. You can Interact with an adjacent mounted siege weapon to increase its Speed by 10 feet for one round.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ivSf8wSIUkK8gwej]{Live Ammunition} Feat 8</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>There are generally few things as ill-advised as being shot out of a cannon or launched by a trebuchet, but people use the tactic every so often in a desperate situation. While it's more humane to use this strategy with mindless constructs or undead, occasionally an exceedingly foolhardy adventurer demands the opportunity to try it. Loading a creature requires two additional Load actions, which you must conduct personally. The creature must be willing, unconscious, or restrained throughout the process, and the siege weapon must be physically capable of firing the creature in question, based on their size and shape. Typically, that means ballistas don't qualify, for example—nor do auto-catapults which require specifically-sized balls—but normal catapults and onagers work just fine. When you Launch the weapon, if the weapon usually targets an area, you target a single 5-foot square instead. The siege weapon deals its normal damage to its target, or to the modified area, and to the creature fired.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kVSZQvsz1cYjOwxL]{Master Siege Engineer} Feat 16</h2>\n<hr />\n<p>What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently quickened. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.</p>"

		"Beast Gunner": {
			"name": "Beast Gunner",
			"description": "<h1>Beast Gunner</h1>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> uncommon</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as “beast guns” is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4>Choosing Your Beast Gun</h4>\n<p>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.L1gD3VMD5X9JNJzE]{Beast Gunner Dedication} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt (see above); trained in Arcana and Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've bonded to your beast gun and unlocked the first hints of its hidden potential.

			"name": "Dragon Disciple",
			"description": "<h1>Dragon Disciple</h1>\n<p>The rippling waves of fear, the rustling of thick scales, and the beat of immense wings signal the arrival of a great dragon. The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p>\n<p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTINCT OF THE WYRM</strong></p>\n<p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.oo34CloLefFRi72w]{Dragon Disciple Dedication} Feat 2</span></p>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell levels of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.</p>\n<p>Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell level of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature.

Detaching or reattaching the familiar to transform it is a two-action activity. Even in mask form, the familiar can move around on its master's face and speaks in a distinct voice (if it can talk). It is easily recognized as more than a simple mask unless the familiar succeeds at a Deception check to Impersonate a mask. Other than its appearance and the fact that it can be worn, it functions as other familiars. Your mask familiar has access to the mask freeze familiar ability</p>\n<p><strong>Mask Freeze</strong> When in mask form, your familiar can hide its obvious supernatural qualities to pass as a simple, unassuming mask.

The hideaway's access point appears as an obviously magical gap within 1 foot of your body. Only you can access the hideaway; you can you use an Interact action each round to physically hold it open for another person. A successful dispel magic spell or similar effect against your spell DC and the hideaway's counteract level of 2 expels the object; the object is also expelled if you become unconscious.

When you use Uzunjati Recollection to tell a story and @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} about a creature during a combat encounter, if you succeed at both checks, your story carries deeper meaning. This grants your allies a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll and saving throw against the creature during that encounter, as well as to their AC against that creature's next attack roll during that encounter.

Your secret identity lets you adventure and carry out clandestine missions while keeping the civilians you care about safe. Whatever your purpose- fighting crime, inciting rebellion, sowing chaos-your vigilante identity makes you both hard to pin down and a mysterious, intriguing subject of gossip.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 4th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qFt6zyWVX1njJf1l]{Quick Draw}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uqIiSDbv80TbRwTQ]{Vigilante Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Deception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have two identities, each with its own name, alignment, and abilities. Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a Seek action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC, as if you were using the Impersonate action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity-a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.</p>\n<p>Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to Recall Knowledge about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the detect alignment spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.</p>\n<p>To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits: social or vigilante. You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Vigilante archetype.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.K3Au5071pfvNwGob]{Hidden Magic} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations. A spellcaster using detect magic or read aura must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.rAbfuZ1mc3lUYH41]{Minion Guise} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> animal companion or familiar, expert in Deception, Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When you are in your social identity, you can also grant a social identity to an animal companion, familiar, or other minion you gained from a class feature. When changing to your social identity, you also change your minion's appearance to that of a socially acceptable creature of its type, such as grooming a wolf to appear as a large dog or disguising a familiar to appear as an exotic pet. Commanding your minion to use unusual magical or combat abilities it gained from your class features or feats while in this social identity risks exposing your vigilante identity.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.vKzAIJuyr9SU2JzU]{Safe House} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world. This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave. The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of nondetection, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level. Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime. The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.rNPeOwFZE5Ma18JJ]{Social Purview} Feat 4</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have built a reputation for yourself in your social identity. Choose one archetype that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that archetype's dedication feat and can select feats from that archetype, even if you haven't yet gained enough feats in the vigilante archetype to take another dedication feat. These feats become part of your social identity and gain the social trait-for instance, a fighter vigilante could take the wizard dedication feat and have a wizard social identity. Using these feats in your social identity doesn't risk exposing your vigilante identity, but using them in your vigilante identity could put you at risk for exposure.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qg8TlLJRgvjzW9YK]{Startling Appearance} Feat 6</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Vigilante Dedication</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence.

Whenever you change your identity, instead of taking on your social or vigilante identity, you can become someone completely ordinary. This identity isn't a specific individual-rather, you become a nondescript member of your ancestry, of any gender, with a neutral alignment and a mundane occupation such as common laborer, farmer, or peasant. Spells and abilities detect you as if you were this ordinary identity, rather than either of your two real identities, unless they succeed at a counteract check against your Deception DC.

			"description": "<h1>Viking</h1>\n<p>To go 'viking' is to raid by sea, and thus vikings have spread far and wide. Some have even settled in the very communities they once raided. Vikings traditionally travel in longboats; a score of these warriors might live aboard their ship for days at a time, sailing the seas (or, as they call it, the 'whale-road') to ambush coastal communities. Once they arrive at a settlement, they charge ashore, plundering all they can find and slaying anyone foolish enough to get in their way. The ferocity of viking raids is legendary.</p>\n<p>Additional Feats: 4th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.w8Ycgeq2zfyshtoS]{Reactive Shield}; 6th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tHqlcgcxHXzqLHPZ]{Shielded Stride}; 10th @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pRqcm5P2ZFihSpVI]{Quick Shield Block}</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.JuEUNrvsxOYdXeYL]{Viking Dedication} Feat 2</h2>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Athletics</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Vikings spend long periods of time at sea, only to leap from their boats at a moment's notice, charge through the surf, and take their enemies by storm.
